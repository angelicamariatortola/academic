abstract={Simulating spatial Gaussian realizations is one of the core components of geostatistics and numerous other fields involving uncertainty, risk, and reliability. The use of decorrelation methods and truncated Gaussian algorithms further promotes the use of Gaussian realizations. In multivariate cases, geological variables may represent different scales and exhibit different spatial structures and anisotropy that complicates decorrelation methods. For cases where spatial dependencies cannot be removed using techniques such as the projection pursuit multivariate transform coupled with maximum autocorrelation factors, cokriging is advocated and requires a model of coregionalization. However, blind source separation represents the original multivariate problem as a linear combination of latent source variables, each one having a spatial structure from the linear model of coregionalization (LMC). The latent source variables or factors are independent and follow a standard normal distribution facilitating the use of Gaussian simulation algorithms. Moreover, different algorithms may be utilized for each variable given that some are more efficient at generating realizations for different spatial covariance functions. Recovering the original variables afterwards is straightforward. The theory for this decomposition is presented. A small numerical example is used to explain the theory and the proposed approach is illustrated through a case study with geochemical sample data. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Modeling a mineral microstructure accurately in three dimensions can render realistic mineralogical patterns which can be used for three-dimensional processing simulations and calculation of three-dimensional mineral quantities. The present study introduces a flexible approach to model the microstructure of mineral material composed of a large number of facies. The common plurigaussian method, a valuable approach in geostatistics, can account for correlations within each facies and in principle be extended to correlations between the facies. Assuming stationarity and isotropy, founded on a new description of this model, formulas for first- and second-order characteristics, such as volume fraction, correlation function and cross-correlation function can be given by a multivariate normal distribution. In this particular situation, based on first- and second-order statistics, a fitting procedure can be developed which requires only numerical inversion of several one-dimensional monotone functions. The paper describes the whole workflow. The covariance structure is quickly obtained from two-dimensional particle pixel images using Fourier transform. Followed by model fitting and sampling, where the resulting three-dimensional microstructure is then efficiently represented by tessellations. The applicability is demonstrated for the three-dimensional case by modeling the microstructure from a Mineral Liberation Analyzer image data set of an andesitic basalt breccia. © 2020, International Association for Mathematical Geosciences.},

abstract={The classical linear model of coregionalization and its simpler counterpart known as the proportional covariance model, or intrinsic correlation model, have become standard tools in many areas of application for the analysis of multivariate spatial data. Despite the merits of this model, it guarantees optimal predictions only in the case of Gaussian data and can lead to erroneous conclusions in all other circumstances, in particular in the presence of skew data. To deal with multivariate geostatistical data showing some degree of skewness, this article proposes a latent spatial factor model in which all finite-dimensional marginal distributions are multivariate unified skew-normal. For this model, we can write the log-likelihood function of the data and implement a maximum likelihood estimation procedure which enables the simultaneous estimation of all parameters of the model. Moreover, we also show how the computational burden involved in the nonlinear mapping of the latent factors can be substantially reduced by exploiting a linearity property of the predictions. The sampling performances of the inferential procedures are investigated in some thorough simulation studies, and an application to radioactive contamination data is presented to show the flexibility of the model. Detailed derivations of our results are available as Supplementary Material. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={The prevalence of spatially referenced multivariate data has impelled researchers to develop procedures for joint modeling of multiple spatial processes. This ordinarily involves modeling marginal and cross-process dependence for any arbitrary pair of locations using a multivariate spatial covariance function. However, building a flexible multivariate spatial covariance function that is nonnegative definite is challenging. Here, we propose a semiparametric approach for multivariate spatial covariance function estimation with approximate Matern marginals and highly flexible cross-covariance functions via their spectral representations. The flexibility in our cross-covariance function arises due to B-spline–based specification of the underlying coherence functions, which in turn allows us to capture nontrivial cross-spectral features. We then develop a likelihood-based estimation procedure and perform multiple simulation studies to demonstrate the performance of our method, especially on the coherence function estimation. Finally, we analyze particulate matter concentrations (PM2.5) and wind speed data over the West-North-Central climatic region of the United States, where we illustrate that our proposed method outperforms the commonly used full bivariate Matern model and the linear model of coregionalization for spatial prediction. © 2020 The International Biometric Society},

abstract={The geostatistical analysis of multivariate spatial data for inference as well as joint predictions (co-kriging) ordinarily relies on modeling of the marginal and cross-covariance functions. While the former quantifies the spatial dependence within variables, the latter quantifies the spatial dependence across distinct variables. The marginal covariance functions are always symmetric; however, the cross-covariance functions often exhibit asymmetries in the real data. Asymmetric cross-covariance implies change in the value of cross-covariance for interchanged locations on fixed order of variables. Such change of cross-covariance values is often caused due to the spatial delay in effect of the response of one variable on another variable. These spatial delays are common in environmental processes, especially when dynamic phenomena such as prevailing wind and ocean currents are involved. Here, we propose a novel approach to introduce flexible asymmetries in the cross-covariances of stationary multivariate covariance functions. The proposed approach involves modeling the phase component of the constrained cross-spectral features to allow for asymmetric cross-covariances. We show the capability of our proposed model to recover the cross-dependence structure and improve spatial predictions against traditionally used models through multiple simulation studies. Additionally, we illustrate our approach on a real trivariate dataset of particulate matter concentration (PM 2.5), wind speed and relative humidity. The real data example shows that our approach outperforms the traditionally used models, in terms of model fit and spatial predictions.

abstract={We study multivariate Gaussian random fields defined over ddimensional spheres. First, we provide a nonparametric Bayesian framework for modeling and inference on matrix-valued covariance functions. We determine the support (under the topology of uniform convergence) of the proposed random matrices, which cover the whole class of matrix-valued geodesically isotropic covariance functions on spheres. We provide a thorough inspection of the properties of the proposed model in terms of (a) first moments, (b) posterior distributions, and (c) Lipschitz continuities. We then provide an approximation method for multivariate fields on the sphere for which measures of Lp accuracy are established. Our findings are supported through simulation studies that show the rate of convergence when truncating a spectral expansion of a multivariate random field at a finite order.

abstract={We present a preconditioned Monte Carlo method for computing high-dimensional multivariate normal and Student-t probabilities arising in spatial statistics. The approach combines a tile-low-rank representation of covariance matrices with a block-reordering scheme for efficient quasi-Monte Carlo simulation. The tile-low-rank representation decomposes the high-dimensional problem into many diagonal-block-size problems and low-rank connections. The block-reordering scheme reorders between and within the diagonal blocks to reduce the impact of integration variables from right to left, thus improving the Monte Carlo convergence rate. Simulations up to dimension 65,536 suggest that the new method can improve the run time by an order of magnitude compared with the hierarchical quasi-Monte Carlo method and two orders of magnitude compared with the dense quasi-Monte Carlo method. Our method also forms a strong substitute for the approximate conditioning methods as a more robust estimation with error guarantees. An application study to wind stochastic generators is provided to illustrate that the new computational method makes the maximum likelihood estimation feasible for high-dimensional skew-normal random fields. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.},

Many modeling proposals have been made in this area, which could be grouped into three large sets: coregionalization, multivariate conditional and univariate conditional models. In this work we establish some links between these three groups of proposals. Specifically, we explore the equivalence between the two conditional approaches and show that an important class of coregionalization models can be seen as a large subclass of the conditional approaches. Additionally, we propose an extension to the current set of coregionalization models with some new unexplored proposals. This extension is able to reproduce asymmetric cross-spatial covariances for different diseases. This shows that the previously accepted belief that coregionalization was not able to reproduce models with asymmetric cross-covariances was wrong. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In multivariate spatio-temporal analysis, we are faced with the formidable challenge of specifying a valid spatio-temporal cross-covariance function, either directly or through the construction of processes. This task is difficult as these functions should yield positive definite covariance matrices. In recent years, we have seen a flourishing of methods and theories on constructing spatio-temporal cross-covariance functions satisfying the positive definiteness requirement. A subset of those techniques produced spatio-temporal cross-covariance functions possessing the additional feature of nonstationarity. Here we provide a review of the state-of-the-art methods and technical progress regarding model construction. In addition, we introduce a rich class of multivariate spatio-temporal asymmetric nonstationary models stemming from the Lagrangian framework. We demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed models on a bivariate reanalysis climate model output dataset previously analyzed using purely spatial models. Furthermore, we carry out a cross-validation study to examine the advantages of using spatio-temporal models over purely spatial models.

abstract={For many applications with multivariate data, random-field models capturing departures from Gaussianity within realizations are appropriate. For this reason, we formulate a new class of multivariate non-Gaussian models based on systems of stochastic partial differential equations with additive type G noise whose marginal covariance functions are of Matern type. We consider four increasingly flexible constructions of the noise, where the first two are similar to existing copula-based models. In contrast with these, the last two constructions can model non-Gaussian spatial data without replicates. Computationally efficient methods for likelihood-based parameter estimation and probabilistic prediction are proposed, and the flexibility of the models suggested is illustrated by numerical examples and two statistical applications. © 2019 Royal Statistical Society},

abstract={In this study, we attempt to discover repeated patterns of stock index through analysis of multivariate time series. Our motivation is based on the notion that financial planning guided by pattern discovery of stock index may be more effective. A two-stage architecture constructed by combining Toeplitz Inverse Covariance-Based Clustering (TICC) with betweenness centrality is applied for pattern discovery of stock index. In the first stage, TICC is used to discover repeated patterns of stock index’s multivariate time series. Then, in the second stage, betweenness centrality scores that reveal the relative “importance” of each influencing factor are plotted by Markov random field (MRF) which is derived from the first experiment. The Hangseng Stock Index and five influencing factors are used in the experiment. Empirical results show that six kinds of time-invariant patterns with flexible and long-term time periods are discovered in Hangseng Stock Index, and that different influencing factors have different betweenness scores in each cluster. This empirical research provides new ideas of stock index prediction and portfolio construction for scholars and investors. Moreover, the long-period repeated patterns that are discovered in this paper increase the possibility to reduce transaction cost for portfolio construction which then, maybe more applicable to the real financial markets. © 2020, Institute for Economic Forecasting.

abstract={The high volatility of world soybean prices has caused uncertainty and vulnerability particularly in the developing countries. The clustering of time series is a serviceable tool for discovering soybean price patterns in temporal data. However, traditional clustering method cannot represent the continuity of price data very well, nor keep a watchful eye on the correlation between factors. In this work, the authors use the Toeplitz Inverse Covariance-Based Clustering of Multivariate Time Series Data (TICC) to soybean price pattern discovery. This is a new method for multivariate time series clustering, which can simultaneously segment and cluster the time series data. Each pattern in the TICC method is defined by a Markov random field (MRF), characterizing the interdependencies between different factors of that pattern. Based on this representation, the characteristics of each pattern and the importance of each factor can be portrayed.

abstract={The paper provides a way to model axially symmetric random fields defined over the two-dimensional unit sphere embedded in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. Specifically, our strategy is to integrate an isotropic random field on the sphere over longitudinal arcs with a given central angle. The resulting random field is shown to be axially symmetric and to have the arc central angle as a tuning parameter that allows for isotropy as well as for longitudinal independence as limit cases. We then consider multivariate longitudinally integrated random fields, having the same properties of axial symmetry and a tuning parameter (arc central angle) proper to each random field component. This construction allows for a unified framework for vector-valued random fields that can be geodesically isotropic, axially symmetric, or longitudinally independent. Additionally, all the components of the vector random field are allowed to be cross-correlated. We finally show how to simulate the proposed axially symmetric scalar and vector random fields through a computationally efficient algorithm that exactly reproduces the desired covariance structure and provides approximately Gaussian finite-dimensional distributions. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The construction of valid and flexible cross-covariance functions is a fundamental task for modeling multivariate space–time data arising from, e.g., climatological and oceanographical phenomena. Indeed, a suitable specification of the covariance structure allows to capture both the space–time dependencies between the observations and the development of accurate predictions. For data observed over large portions of planet earth it is necessary to take into account the curvature of the planet. Hence the need for random field models defined over spheres across time. In particular, the associated covariance function should depend on the geodesic distance, which is the most natural metric over the spherical surface. In this work, we propose a flexible parametric family of matrix-valued covariance functions, with both marginal and cross structure being of the Gneiting type. We also introduce a different multivariate Gneiting model based on the adaptation of the latent dimension approach to the spherical context. Finally, we assess the performance of our models through the study of a bivariate space–time data set of surface air temperatures and precipitable water content. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The objective of this study was to evaluate the spatial variability of soybean yield, carbon stock, and soil physical attributes using multivariate and geostatistical techniques. The attributes were determined in Oxisols samples with clayey and cohesive textures collected from the municipality of Mata Roma, Maranhão state, Brazil. In the study area, 70 sampling points were demarcated, and soybean yield and soil attributes were evaluated at soil depths of 0-0.20 and 0.20-0.40 m. Data were analysed using multivariate analyses (principal component analysis, PCA) and geostatistical tools. The mean soybean yield was 3,370 kg ha-1. The semivariogram of productivity, organic carbon (OC), and carbon stock (Cst) at the 0-0.20 m layer were adjusted to the spherical model. The PCA explained 73.21% of the variance and covariance structure between productivity and soil attributes at the 0-0.20 m layer [(PCA 1 (26.89%), PCA 2 (24.10%), and PCA 3 (22.22%)] and 68.64% at the 0.20-0.40 m layer [PCA 1 (31.95%), PCA 2 (22.83%), and PCA 3 (13.85%)]. The spatial variability maps of the PCA eigenvalue scores showed that it is possible to determine management zones using PCA 1 in the two studied depths; however, with different management strategies for each of the layers in this study. © 2019, Departamento de Engenharia Agricola - UFCG/Cnpq.

abstract={The spatial variability of geomaterials affects the failure mechanism and reliability of geotechnical structures significantly, and can be modeled rigorously as a three-dimensional (3-D) random field. However, the simulation of multivariate, large-scale and high-resolution 3-D random fields is a challenging task due to extraordinary demands in computational resources. This paper proposes a stepwise covariance matrix decomposition method (CMD) with the aid of separable correlation functions, in which the 3-D random field is generated sequentially along each single dimension with small one-dimensional correlation matrices. The method not only inherits the simplicity of the widely-used general CMD, but also significantly reduces the computational time and required memory space. It only takes a few seconds to construct large-scale and high-resolution 3-D random fields, with the requirement on memory space reduced by more than ten orders of magnitude. The maximum random field resolution is significantly improved from approximately 21 × 21 × 41 using the general CMD to over 501 × 501 × 1001 using the stepwise CMD, which suffices in most engineering applications. The stepwise CMD facilitates 3-D spatial variability modeling in probabilistic site characterization and routine geotechnical reliability analysis. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

Its finite-dimensional distributions have thin tails, even thinner than those of a Gaussian one, and it reduces to a Linnik or Laplace vector random field in a limiting case. As one of its most valuable properties, a K-differenced vector random field is characterized by its mean and covariance matrix functions just like a Gaussian one.

abstract={We propose a new copula model for replicated multivariate spatial data. Unlike classical models that assume multivariate normality of the data, the proposed copula is based on the assumption that some factors exist that affect the joint spatial dependence of all measurements of each variable as well as the joint dependence among these variables. The model is parameterized in terms of a cross-covariance function that may be chosen from the many models proposed in the literature. In addition, there are additive factors in the model that allow tail dependence and reflection asymmetry of each variable measured at different locations, and of different variables to be modeled. The proposed approach can therefore be seen as an extension of the linear model of coregionalization widely used for modeling multivariate spatial data. The likelihood of the model can be obtained in a simple form and, therefore, the likelihood estimation is quite fast. The model is not restricted to the set of data locations, and using the estimated copula, spatial data can be interpolated at locations where values of variables are unknown. We apply the proposed model to temperature and pressure data, and we compare its performance with that of a popular model from multivariate geostatistics. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The uncertainty simulation related to a spatially varying physical property requires the theory of the random field discretization. A random field in definition consists of an infinite number of random variables that are attached to all points within the simulation domain. The utility of the Karhunen–Loève (K–L) expansion allows representing a second-order random field as the summation of a few deterministic functions and standard random variables. However, the K–L expansion depends on exact eigensolutions of the Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. Along with an emerging trend of the random field simulation combined with a complex geometry, analytical expansion results are increasingly inapplicable in engineering reality. To this end, the paper presents a high-order polynomial based Ritz–Galerkin approach. To implement, the Legendre, the Chebyshev, and the Gegenbauer orthogonal polynomials are used to realize the Ritz–Galerkin approximation. Together with the Gaussian-quadrature based interpolation scheme in approximating covariance models, numerical results for eigensolutions have demonstrated the spectral accuracy of the proposed approach. Results for the non-stationary, non-Gaussian and multivariate random field simulations have validated the high-order polynomial based Ritz–Galerkin approach has engineering applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Some recent work on conditional formulation of multivariate Gaussian Markov random fields is presented. The focus is on model constructions by compatible conditionals and coregionalization. Special attention is given to multivariate generalizations of univariate models. Beginning with univariate model constructions, a survey of key approaches to formulating multivariate extensions is presented. Two challenges in the formulation and implementation of multivariate models are highlighted: (1) entanglement of spatial and non-spatial components, and (2) enforcement for positivity condition. Managing the two challenges by decomposition, separation, and constrained parameterization is discussed. Also highlighted is the challenge of flexible modeling of (conditional) cross-spatial dependencies and, in particular, asymmetric cross-spatial dependencies. Interpretation of asymmetric cross-spatial dependencies is also discussed. A coregionalization framework which connects and unifies the various lines of model development is presented. The framework enables a systematic development of a broad range of models via linear and spatially varying coregionalization, respectively, with extensions to locally adaptive models. Formulation of multivariate models over variable-specific lattices is discussed. Selected models are illustrated with examples of Bayesian multivariate and spatiotemporal disease mapping. Potential applications of coregionalization models in imaging analysis, covariance modeling, dimension reduction, and latent variable analysis are briefly mentioned. © 2018, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.},

abstract={Matrix-valued covariance functions are crucial to geostatistical modelling of multivariate spatial data. The classical assumption of symmetry of a multivariate covariance function is overly restrictive and has been considered as unrealistic for most of the real data applications. Despite of that, the literature on asymmetric covariance functions has been very sparse. In particular, there is some work related to asymmetric covariances on Euclidean spaces, depending on the Euclidean distance. However, for data collected over large portions of planet Earth, the most natural spatial domain is a sphere, with the corresponding geodesic distance being the natural metric. In this work, we propose a strategy based on spatial rotations to generate asymmetric covariances for multivariate random fields on the d-dimensional unit sphere. We illustrate through simulations as well as real data analysis that our proposal allows to achieve improvements in the predictive performance in comparison to the symmetric counterpart. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This work focuses on the characterization of the central tendency of a sample of compositional data. It provides new results about theoretical properties of means and covariance functions for compositional data, with an axiomatic perspective. Original results that shed new light on geostatistical modeling of compositional data are presented. As a first result, it is shown that the weighted arithmetic mean is the only central tendency characteristic satisfying a small set of axioms, namely continuity, reflexivity, and marginal stability. Moreover, this set of axioms also implies that the weights must be identical for all parts of the composition. This result has deep consequences for spatial multivariate covariance modeling of compositional data. In a geostatistical setting, it is shown as a second result that the proportional model of covariance functions (i.e., the product of a covariance matrix and a single correlation function) is the only model that provides identical kriging weights for all components of the compositional data. As a consequence of these two results, the proportional model of covariance function is the only covariance model compatible with reflexivity and marginal stability. © 2017, International Association for Mathematical Geosciences.},

abstract={Models for multivariate space–time geostatistical data have received a growing interest in spatial and spatiotemporal epidemiology. However, specifying models that can capture associations within and among multivariate measurements is usually a challenge. The main goal of this paper is to introduce and review cross-covariance functions that are rich in structure and are computationally feasible. Integrated nested Laplace approximation combined with stochastic partial differential equations were used for inference and prediction, as a fast and precise alternative to the computationally intensive Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. A large set of models is considered in this paper: models assuming independent, shared or correlated spatial and temporal processes (with nine possible combinations), and models with independent, shared and linear models of coregionalization spatiotemporal processes. Different processes are applied to Culicoides data and compared. Bayesian spatial prediction results show that the central and Northeastern parts of Belgium had the highest prevalence of Culicoides in summer months and the lowest prevalence in winter months. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This paper considers a multivariate spatial random field, with each component having univariate marginal distributions of the skew-Gaussian type. We assume that the field is defined spatially on the unit sphere embedded in R3, allowing for modeling data available over large portions of planet Earth. This model admits explicit expressions for the marginal and cross covariances. However, the n-dimensional distributions of the field are difficult to evaluate, because it requires the sum of 2n terms involving the cumulative and probability density functions of a n-dimensional Gaussian distribution. Since in this case inference based on the full likelihood is computationally unfeasible, we propose a composite likelihood approach based on pairs of spatial observations. This last being possible thanks to the fact that we have a closed form expression for the bivariate distribution. We illustrate the effectiveness of the method through simulation experiments and the analysis of a real data set of minimum and maximum surface air temperatures. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

The covariance model is based on a flexible bivariate Matern covariance function for the streamfunction and velocity potential. It allows for different variances in the potentials, nonzero correlations between them, anisotropy, and a flexible smoothness parameter. The joint covariance function of the related variables is derived analytically. Further, it is shown that a consistent model with nonzero correlations between the potentials and positive definite covariance function is possible. The statistical model is fitted to forecasts of the horizontal wind fields of a mesoscale numerical weather prediction system. Parameter uncertainty is assessed by a parametric bootstrap method.

abstract={Multivariate spatial field data are increasingly common and their modeling typically relies on building cross-covariance functions to describe cross-process relationships. An alternative viewpoint is to model the matrix of spectral measures. We develop the notions of coherence, phase, and gain for multidimensional stationary processes. Coherence, as a function of frequency, is a measure of linear relationship between two spatial processes at that frequency. We use the coherence function to illustrate fundamental limitations on a number of previously proposed constructions for multivariate processes, suggesting these options are not viable for data modeling. We also give natural interpretations to cross-covariance parameters of the Matern class, where the cross-smoothness controls the decay of coherence at infinitely high frequencies, and the cross-range parameter controls the frequency of greatest coherence. These interpretations provide warnings for particular parameter combinations that imply potentially non-physical relationships between variables. Estimation follows from smoothed multivariate periodogram matrices. We illustrate the estimation and interpretation of these functions on two datasets, forecast and reanalysis sea level pressure and geopotential heights over the equatorial region.},

abstract={Core logging is the geological study, recording and classification of petrophysical attributes of drill hole samples, such as lithology, alteration or mineralogical assemblage. The geological logging is qualitative and subject to errors because of its visual nature and other factors inherent to logging, such as low drill hole recoveries, difficulties in estimating the volumetric contents of minerals, or different logging criteria among geologists. To date, different tools for quality control and validation of geological logging have been elaborated, based on geological knowledge, statistics, geostatistics, image analysis, neural network and data mining. This paper presents an alternative approach based on geostatistical modeling for identifying and reclassifying potentially mislogged samples when quantitative covariates from geochemical analyses or metallurgical tests are available. The principle of this approach is to: (i) define geological domains for each quantitative variable by an adequate grouping of the log classes; (ii) transform the quantitative variables into normal scores, accounting for the previously defined domains, (iii) model the spatial correlation structure of the normal scores, (iv) perform leave-one-out cross validation and obtain predictions of the normal variables and the associated variance-covariance matrices of prediction errors; (v) calculate a measure of consistency for each sample and each possible logged class under a multivariate normal assumption; and (vi) compare these measures of consistency with the actual logged classes to detect suspicious logs. The methodology is demonstrated in a case study from an iron ore deposit, with data of rock type logged by geologists and seven quantitative variables (grades of elements of interest, loss on ignition and granulometry). © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Multivariate geostatistics is based on modelling all covariances between all possible combinations of two or more variables at any sets of locations in a continuously indexed domain. Multivariate spatial covariance models need to be built with care, since any covariance matrix that is derived from such a model must be nonnegative-definite. In this article, we develop a conditional approach for spatial-model construction whose validity conditions are easy to check. We start with bivariate spatial covariance models and go on to demonstrate the approach's connection to multivariate models defined by networks of spatial variables. In some circumstances, such as modelling respiratory illness conditional on air pollution, the direction of conditional dependence is clear. When it is not, the two directional models can be compared. More generally, the graph structure of the network reduces the number of possible models to compare. Model selection then amounts to finding possible causative links in the network. We demonstrate our conditional approach on surface temperature and pressure data, where the role of the two variables is seen to be asymmetric. © 2016 Biometrika Trust.},

abstract={Conventional geostatistical simulation methods are implemented in a way that is inherently gridded and sequence dependent. A variant of spectral simulation method is revisited from a linear model of regionalization standpoint to simulate realizations of coregionalized variables that are expressed as a function of the coordinates of the simulation locations, data values, and imposed spatial structure. The resulting grid-free simulation (GFS) methodology expresses a realization at any set of regularly or irregularly distributed nodes. GFS consists of two main steps: unconditional grid-free simulation and dual cokriging-based conditioning. The unconditional multivariate simulation is represented by a linear model of coregionalization, where weights are derived from the covariance function of the modeled system, and random factors are computed as a sum of equally weighted line processes within a turning bands paradigm. These stochastic line processes are expressed as a linear model of regionalization, weights are from the Fourier series decomposition of line covariance functions, and random factors have a cosine function form requiring coordinates of simulation locations and the random phases. The resulting conditionally simulated values are uniquely tied to simulation locations by an analytical form. Newly assimilated data change current realizations only locally within the correlation range. The GFS parameters are carefully chosen from a series of examples, and the associated theory is illustrated with a three-dimensional case study. © 2016, International Association for Mathematical Geosciences.},

abstract={Multivariate space–time data are increasingly available in various scientific disciplines. When analyzing these data, one of the key issues is to describe the multivariate space–time dependences. Under the Gaussian framework, one needs to propose relevant models for multivariate space–time covariance functions, i.e. matrix-valued mappings with the additional requirement of non-negative definiteness. We propose a flexible parametric class of cross-covariance functions for multivariate space–time Gaussian random fields. Space–time components belong to the (univariate) Gneiting class of space–time covariance functions, with Matern or Cauchy covariance functions in the spatial margins. The smoothness and scale parameters can be different for each variable. We provide sufficient conditions for positive definiteness. A simulation study shows that the parameters of this model can be efficiently estimated using weighted pairwise likelihood, which belongs to the class of composite likelihood methods. We then illustrate the model on a French dataset of weather variables. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

Some of these covariance models are very flexible and can capture both the marginal and the cross-spatial dependence of the components of the associated multivariate Gaussian random field.

Maximum likelihood is certainly a useful tool, but it is impractical in all the circumstances where the number of observations is very large.

abstract={A novel grid-free geostatistical simulation method (GFS) allows representing coregionalized variables as an analytical function of the coordinates of the simulation locations. Simulation on unstructured grids, regridding and refinement of available realizations of natural phenomena including, but not limited to, environmental systems are possible with GFS in a consistent manner. The unconditional realizations are generated by utilizing the linear model of coregionalization and Fourier series-based decomposition of the covariance function. The conditioning to data is performed by kriging. The data can be measured at scattered point-scale locations or sampled at a block scale. Secondary data are usually used in conjunction with primary data for the improved modeling. Satellite imaging is an example of exhaustively sampled secondary data. Improvements and recommendations are made to the implementation of GFS to properly assimilate secondary exhaustive data sets in a grid-free manner. Intrinsic cokriging (ICK) is utilized to reduce computational time and preserve the overall quality of the simulation. To further reduce the computational cost of ICK, a block matrix inversion is implemented in the calculation of the kriging weights. A projection approach to ICK is proposed to avoid artifacts in the realizations around the edges of the exhaustive data region when the data do not cover the entire modeling domain. The point-scale block value representation of the block-scale data is developed as an alternative to block cokriging to integrate block-scale data into realizations within the GFS framework. Several case studies support the proposed enhancements. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Defined as mixtures of Gaussian random fields with an exponential variable embedded for the variance, these processes possess useful asymptotic properties while remaining statistically convenient. Univariate Laplace distribution tails are part of the limiting generalized Pareto distributions for threshold exceedances. After normalizing marginal distributions in data, a standard Laplace field can be used to capture spatial dependence among extremes. Asymptotic properties of Laplace fields are explored and compared to the classical framework of asymptotic dependence. Multivariate joint tail decay rates are slower than for Gaussian fields with the same covariance structure; hence they provide more conservative estimates of very extreme joint risks while maintaining asymptotic independence. Statistical inference is illustrated on extreme wind gusts in the Netherlands where a comparison to the Gaussian dependence model shows a better goodness-of-fit. In this application we fit the well-adapted Weibull distribution, closely related to the Laplace distribution, as univariate tail model. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In this article, we propose stationary covariance functions for processes that evolve temporally over a sphere, as well as cross-covariance functions for multivariate random fields defined over a sphere. For such processes, the great circle distance is the natural metric that should be used to describe spatial dependence. Given the mathematical difficulties for the construction of covariance functions for processes defined over spheres cross time, approximations of the state of nature have been proposed in the literature by using the Euclidean (based on map projections) and the chordal distances. We present several methods of construction based on the great circle distance and provide closed-form expressions for both spatio-temporal and multivariate cases. A simulation study assesses the discrepancy between the great circle distance, chordal distance, and Euclidean distance based on a map projection both in terms of estimation and prediction in a space-time and a bivariate spatial setting, where the space is in this case the Earth. We revisit the analysis of Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data and investigate differences in terms of estimation and prediction between the aforementioned distance-based approaches. Both simulation and real data highlight sensible differences in terms of estimation of the spatial scale parameter. As far as prediction is concerned, the differences can be appreciated only when the interpoint distances are large, as demonstrated by an illustrative example.

abstract={Levelling is used in rice fields to correct land irregularities for management practice improvement. Effects of levelling have been evaluated using univariate tools from classical statistics and geostatistics, which disregard possible effects on interrelations among soil properties. This study aimed to: (i) evaluate the effect of levelling on soil physico-chemical properties using classical statistics and geostatistical tools, (ii) group soil properties in homogeneous sets using multivariate cluster analysis, (iii) reduce the dimensionality of sets by principal component analysis, and (iv) characterize and map spatial distributions of principal components to compare them with individual maps to elaborate maps of homogeneous management zones. On a 1.0. ha field in Southern Brazil a grid of 10. ×. 10. m points was used to sample the 0-0.20. m soil layer, before and after levelling. All data sets were submitted to descriptive statistics and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test, as well as to geostatistical analysis. Maps were constructed using ordinary kriging or the inverse square distance interpolation. Groups were formed by cluster analysis. To reduce their dimensionality principal component analysis and geostatistics were used to evaluate spatial dependencies of the main principal components. Maps of the main principal components and of each soil property were visually compared to verify if they had similar patterns of spatial variability. Levelling caused an increase of the spatial range for the majority of the properties as well as an improvement of the goodness of fit of the semivariogram models. Variability structures of the majority of the properties were best modeled by Gaussian and spherical models. Levelling also caused changes in the variance and covariance structures of all properties as detected by cluster multivariate analysis. Soil bulk density and organic matter represented the sets that were most affected by land levelling, so that their maps are considered useful and accessible tools for farmers in future operations of land recuperation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Multivariate log-Gaussian Cox processes are flexible models for multivariate point patterns. However, they have so far been applied in bivariate cases only. We move beyond the bivariate case to model multispecies point patterns of tree locations. In particular we address the problems of identifying parsimonious models and of extracting biologically relevant information from the models fitted. The latent multivariate Gaussian field is decomposed into components given in terms of random fields common to all species and components which are species specific. This allows a decomposition of variance that can be used to quantify to what extent the spatial variation of a species is governed by common or species-specific factors. Cross-validation is used to select the number of common latent fields to obtain a suitable trade-off between parsimony and fit of the data. The selected number of common latent fields provides an index of complexity of the multivariate covariance structure. Hierarchical clustering is used to identify groups of species with similar patterns of dependence on the common latent fields. © 2016 The Royal Statistical Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Assessing the significance of the correlation between the components of a bivariate random field is of great interest in the analysis of spatial data. This problem has been addressed in the literature using suitable hypothesis testing procedures or using coefficients of spatial association between two sequences. In this paper, testing the association between autocorrelated variables is addressed for the components of a bivariate Gaussian random field using the asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator of a specific parametric class of bivariate covariance models. Explicit expressions for the Fisher information matrix are given for a separable and a nonseparable version of the parametric class, leading to an asymptotic test. The empirical evidence supports our proposal, and as a result, in most of the cases, the new test performs better than the modified t test even when the bivariate covariance model is misspecified or the distribution of the bivariate random field is not Gaussian. Finally, to illustrate how the proposed test works in practice, we study a real dataset concerning the relationship between arsenic and lead from a contaminated area in Utah, USA. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={This work pertains to the simulation of an intrinsic random field of order k with a given generalized covariance function and multivariate Gaussian generalized increments. An iterative algorithm based on the Gibbs sampler is proposed to simulate such a random field at a finite set of locations, resulting in a sequence of random vectors that converges in distribution to a random vector with the desired distribution. The algorithm is tested on synthetic case studies to experimentally assess its rate of convergence, showing that few iterations are sufficient for convergence to take place. The sequence of random vectors also proves to be strongly mixing, allowing the generation of as many independent realizations as desired with a single run of the algorithm. Another interesting property of this algorithm is its versatility, insofar as it can be adapted to construct realizations conditioned to pre-existing data and can be used for any number and configuration of the target locations and any generalized covariance model. © 2014, International Association for Mathematical Geosciences.},

abstract={This paper proposes a methodology to address the classification of images that have been acquired from remote sensors. One common problem in classification is the high dimensionality of multivariate characteristics. The methodology we propose consists of reducing the dimensionality of the spectral bands associated with a multispectral satellite image. Such dimensionality reduction is accomplished by the use of the divergence of a modified Mahalanobis distance. Instead of using the covariance matrix of a multivariate spatial process, the codispersion matrix is considered which have some desirable asymptotic properties under very precise conditions. The consistency and asymptotic normality hold for a general class of processes that are a natural extension of the one-dimensional spatial processes for which the asymptotic properties were first established. The results allow the selection of a set of spectral bands to produce the highest value of divergence. Then, a supervised maximum likelihood method using the selected spectral bands is employed for landscape classification. An application with a real LANDSAT image is introduced to explore and visualize how our method works in practice. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Continuously indexed datasets with multiple variables have become ubiquitous in the geophysical, ecological, environmental and climate sciences, and pose substantial analysis challenges to scientists and statisticians. For many years, scientists developed models that aimed at capturing the spatial behavior for an individual process; only within the last few decades has it become commonplace to model multiple processes jointly. The key difficulty is in specifying the cross-covariance function, that is, the function responsible for the relationship between distinct variables. Indeed, these cross-covariance functions must be chosen to be consistent with marginal covariance functions in such a way that the second-order structure always yields a nonnegative definite covariance matrix. We review the main approaches to building cross-covariance models, including the linear model of coregionalization, convolution methods, the multivariate Matern and nonstationary and space-time extensions of these among others. We additionally cover specialized constructions, including those designed for asymmetry, compact support and spherical domains, with a review of physics-constrained models. We illustrate select models on a bivariate regional climate model output example for temperature and pressure, along with a bivariate minimum and maximum temperature observational dataset; we compare models by likelihood value as well as via cross-validation co-kriging studies. The article closes with a discussion of unsolved problems. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2015.},

abstract={The quality of inferences made from geostatistical data is affected significantly by the spatial locations, or design, of the sites that are sampled. A large body of published work exists on sampling design for univariate geostatistics, but not for multivariate geostatistics. This article considers multivariate spatial sampling design based on criteria targeted at classical co-kriging (prediction with known covariance parameters), estimation of covariance (including cross-covariance) parameters, and empirical co-kriging (prediction with estimated covariance parameters). Through a combination of analytical results and examples, we investigate the characteristics of optimal designs with respect to each criterion, addressing in particular the designs degree of collocation. We also consider the robustness of the optimal design to the strength of spatial correlation and cross-correlation; the effects of smoothness and/or separability of the sampled process on the optimal design; the relationship between optimal designs for the multivariate problems considered here and univariate problems considered previously; and the efficiency of optimal collocated designs. One key finding is that optimal collocated designs are highly efficient in many cases.

These realizations enable simulation-based performance assessment and tuning of various geospatial applications. Both homogeneous and non-homogeneous random fields are addressed. The sequential generation is very fast and compared to methods based on Cholesky decomposition of an a priori covariance matrix and Sequential Gaussian Simulation.

abstract={This paper deals with multivariate disease mapping. We propose a novel framework that encompasses most of the models already proposed. Our framework starts with a simple identity, reformulating Kronecker products of covariance matrices as simple matrix products. This formula is computationally convenient, and its generalizations reproduce most of the proposals in the disease mapping literature. Use of the identity leads to a flexible, general and computationally convenient modelling framework, making it possible to combine spatial dependence structures and different relationships between diseases with limited effort. Moreover, as the proposed modelling framework covers most of the Gaussian Markov random field-based multivariate disease mapping models in the literature, it allows comparison of all these models in a common context, thus helping us to understand them better. © 2013 Biometrika Trust.},

abstract={Two methods for generating representative realizations from Gaussian and lognormal random field models are studied in this paper, with term representative implying realizations efficiently spanning the range of possible attribute values corresponding to the multivariate (log)normal probability distribution. The first method, already established in the geostatistical literature, is multivariate Latin hypercube sampling, a form of stratified random sampling aiming at marginal stratification of simulated values for each variable involved under the constraint of reproducing a known covariance matrix. The second method, scarcely known in the geostatistical literature, is stratified likelihood sampling, in which representative realizations are generated by exploring in a systematic way the structure of the multivariate distribution function itself. The two sampling methods are employed for generating unconditional realizations of saturated hydraulic conductivity in a hydrogeological context via a synthetic case study involving physically-based simulation of flow and transport in a heterogeneous porous medium; their performance is evaluated for different sample sizes (number of realizations) in terms of the reproduction of ensemble statistics of hydraulic conductivity and solute concentration computed from a very large ensemble set generated via simple random sampling. The results show that both Latin hypercube and stratified likelihood sampling are more efficient than simple random sampling, in that overall they can reproduce to a similar extent statistics of the conductivity and concentration fields, yet with smaller sampling variability than the simple random sampling. © 2013 International Association for Mathematical Geosciences.},

The climatic element data referred to 39 National Institute of Meteorology climatic stations located in Minas Gerais state, Brazil and surrounding states. The use of geostatistics and simple cokriging technique enabled the characterization of the spatial variability of the evapotranspiration providing uncertainty information on the spatial prediction pattern. Evapotranspiration and precipitation surfaces were implemented for the climatic classification in Minas Gerais. Multivariate geostatistical determined improvements of evapotranspiration spatial information. The regions in the south of Minas Gerais derived from the moisture index estimated with the MODIS evapotranspiration (2000-2010), presented divergence of humid conditions when compared to the moisture index derived from the simple kriged and cokriged evapotranspiration (1961-1990), indicating climate change in this region. There was stronger pattern of crossed covariance between evapotranspiration and precipitation rather than temperature, indicating that trends in precipitation could be one of the main external drivers of the evapotranspiration in Minas Gerais state, Brazil. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Wien.},

This paper provides different methodologies for the construction of matrix-valued mappings that are positive definite and compactly supported over the sphere of a d-dimensional space, of a given radius. In particular, we offer a representation based on scaled mixtures of Askey functions; we also suggest a method of construction based on B-splines. Finally, we show that the very appealing convolution arguments are indeed effective when working in one dimension, prohibitive in two and feasible, but substantially useless, when working in three dimensions. We exhibit the statistical performance of the proposed models through simulation study and then discuss the computational gains that come from our constructions when the parameters are estimated via maximum likelihood. We finally apply our constructions to a North American Pacific Northwest temperatures dataset. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Measured rainfall data are important to many problems in hydrologic analysis and watershed management. The accurate estimation of the spatial distribution of rainfall requires a dense network of instruments, which entails large installation and operational costs. It is thus necessary to optimize the number of rainfall stations and estimate point precipitation at unrecorded locations from existing valued data. This paper serves 2 objectives: i) to establish a spatial representative rainfall stations from the entire existing network in the study area (i.e., rainfall-data optimization); and ii) to use of multivariate geostatistical algorithm for incorporating relatively cheaper elevation, humidity, and temperature data into the spatial prediction of rainfall at the study site. Yom river is the upstream control for the main Chao Phraya river basin. The technique was illustrated using annual and monthly rainfall observations measured at 326 rain gauge stations covering the entire basin and its vicinity. The precipitation prediction maps, generated by Thiessen polygon, inverse square distance, and ordinary Kriging, were used to determine the sensitivity of the rainfall data to the prediction results by constructing the covariance surface map. Optimal rain gauge network was designed based on the station redundancy and the homogeneity of the rainfall distribution. Ranking of sensitivity in terms of prediction error could define the priority of supplementary stations to satisfy the density of rainfall data in the basin. Digital elevation, humidity, and temperature models were incorporated into the spatial prediction of rainfall using multivariate geostatistical algorithms. The prediction performances of the geostatistical interpolation were cross validated with the straightforward linear regression of rainfall against elevation, humidity, and temperature. The results revealed that the multivariate geostatistical algorithm outperformed the linear regression, stressing the importance of accounting for spatially dependent rainfall observations in addition to the co-located elevation. The digital elevation data were highly correlated to monthly monsoon-induced precipitation in the study area. Humidity and temperature data exhibited a higher degree of correlation to the monthly precipitation data.},

The method can be applied to univariate or to multivariate random fields. Our test is based on the asymptotic normality of certain statistics that are functions of estimators of covariances at certain spatial and temporal lags under weak stationarity. Simulation results for spatial as well as spatio-temporal cases on the two types of spatial domains are reported. We describe the results of testing the stationarity of Pacific wind data, and of testing the axial symmetry of climate model errors for surface temperature using the NOAA GFDL model outputs and the observations from the Climate Research Unit in East Anglia and the Hadley Centre.},

We discuss practical implementations, including reparameterizations to reflect the conditions on the parameter space and an iterative algorithm to increase the computational efficiency. We perform various Monte Carlo simulation experiments to explore the performances of our approach in terms of estimation and cokriging. The application of the proposed multivariate Maternmodel is illustrated on two meteorological datasets: temperature/pressure over the Pacific Northwest (bivariate) and wind/temperature/pressure in Oklahoma (trivariate). In the latter case, our flexible trivariate Matern model is valid and yields better predictive scores compared with a parsimonious model with common scale parameters. © 2012 American Statistical Association.},

abstract={To speed up multivariate geostatistical simulation it is common to transform the set of attributes into spatially uncorrelated factors that can be simulated independently. Spatial decorrelation methods are usually based on the diagonalisation of the variance/covariance and semivariogram matrices of the set of attributes for a chosen family of lag spacings. These matrices are symmetric and there are several efficient methods for the approximate joint diagonalisation of a family of symmetric matrices. One of these is the uniformly weighted exhaustive diagonalisation with Gauss iterations (U-WEDGE) method. In contrast to the method of minimum/maximum autocorrelation factors (MAF), where a two structure linear model of coregionalisation is assumed, U-WEDGE can be applied directly to the set of experimental semivariogram matrices without having to place restrictions on the number of structures in the linear model of coregionalisation, thus removing one of the restrictions placed on the subsequent modelling of the spatial structure of the factors. We use an iron-ore data set to illustrate the method and present a comparison between the simulated attributes obtained from U-WEDGE and MAF with the full co-simulation of the attributes. © 2012 International Association for Mathematical Geosciences.},

abstract={In a paper that appeared in 2010, C. Tone proved a multivariate central limit theorem for some strictly stationary random fields of random vectors satisfying certain mixing conditions. The "normalization" of a given "partial sum" (or "block sum") involved matrix multiplication by a "standard -1/2 power" of its covariance matrix (a symmetric, positive definite matrix), and the limiting multivariate normal distribution had the identity matrix as its covariance matrix. The mixing assumptions in Tone's result implicitly imposed an upper bound on the ratios of the largest to the smallest eigenvalues in the covariance matrices of the partial sums. The purpose of this note is to show that in Tone's result, for the entire collection of the covariance matrices of the partial sums, there is essentially no other restriction on the relative magnitudes of the eigenvalues or on the (orthogonal) directions of the corresponding eigenvectors. For simplicity, the example given in this note will involve just random sequences, not the broader context of random fields. © 2013 University of Illinois.},

abstract={Many farmers want to take advantage of modern technology to control fertilizer applications in large fields more precisely in smaller zones. We have investigated zonation on past yields by three forms of k-means clustering with geostatistical smoothing and compared the outcomes with yield response to added nitrogen. We had data on wheat yield for three. years on 2187 10 × 10. m squares in a 29-ha field in the English midlands. Two of the methods grouped the squares by a 'hard' means technique, the first used their similarities which had been modified with their spatial covariance function and the second used their dissimilarities which had been modified with their variogram. The third method computed their memberships to fuzzy classes and smoothed the memberships with the variogram for final classification. The resulting spatially smoothed classifications were evaluated by the extent to which they responded differentially to applied nitrogen in a fourth year. The best compromise between spatial coherence and minimum variance seemed to be the smoothed fuzzy classification; it created reasonably compact zones that a well-equipped farmer might be able to manage. However, the nitrogen response functions were parallel, and it is unlikely that a farmer would benefit financially by fertilizing the zones separately. The soil map of the field also distinguished coherent compact zones, and these differed in the forms of the responses of their crops to fertilizer nitrogen. For this field, it might be more profitable to manage the nitrogen application according to soil type. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Given i.i.d. observations of a random vector X ∈ ℝ p, we study the problem of estimating both its covariance matrix ∑ *, and its inverse covariance or concentration matrix Θ *=(∑ *) -1. When X is multivariate Gaussian, the non-zero structure of Θ * is specified by the graph of an associated Gaussian Markov random field; and a popular estimator for such sparse Θ * is the ℓ 1-regularized Gaussian MLE. This estimator is sensible even for for non-Gaussian X, since it corresponds to minimizing an ℓ 1-penalized log-determinant Bregman divergence. We analyze its performance under high-dimensional scaling, in which the number of nodes in the graph p, the number of edges s, and the maximum node degree d, are allowed to grow as a function of the sample size n. In addition to the parameters (p,s,d), our analysis identifies other key quantities that control rates: (a) the ℓ ∞-operator norm of the true covariance matrix ∑ *; and (b) the ℓ ∞ operator norm of the sub-matrix Γ * SS, where S indexes the graph edges, and Γ *=(Θ *) -1⊗(Θ *) -1; and (c) a mutual incoherence or irrepresentability measure on the matrix Γ * and (d) the rate of decay 1/f(n,δ) on the probabilities, where is the sample covariance based on n samples. Our first result establishes consistency of our estimate in the elementwise maximum-norm. This in turn allows us to derive convergence rates in Frobenius and spectral norms, with improvements upon existing results for graphs with maximum node degrees. In our second result, we show that with probability converging to one, the estimate correctly specifies the zero pattern of the concentration matrix Θ *. We illustrate our theoretical results via simulations for various graphs and problem parameters, showing good correspondences between the theoretical predictions and behavior in simulations.},

abstract={We consider the problem of supervised classifying the multivariate Gaussian random field (GRF) single observation into one of two populations in case of given training sample. The populations are specified by different regression mean models and by common factorized covariance function. For completely specified populations, we derive a formula for Bayes error rate. In the case of unknown regression parameters and feature covariance matrix, the plug-in Bayes discriminant function based on ML estimators of parameters is used for classification. We derive the actual error rate and the asymptotic expansion of the expected error rate associated with plug-in Bayes discriminant function. These results are multivariate generalizations of previous ones. Numerical analysis of the derived formulas is implemented for the bivariate GRF observations at locations belonging to the two-dimensional lattice with unit spacing. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

abstract={It is common in geostatistics to use the variogram to describe the spatial dependence structure and to use kriging as the spatial prediction methodology. Both methods are sensitive to outlying observations and are strongly influenced by the marginal distribution of the underlying random field. Hence, they lead to unreliable results when applied to extreme value or multimodal data. As an alternative to traditional spatial modeling and interpolation we consider the use of copula functions. This paper extends existing copula-based geostatistical models. We show how location dependent covariates e. g. a spatial trend can be accounted for in spatial copula models. Furthermore, we introduce geostatistical copula-based models that are able to deal with random fields having discrete marginal distributions. We propose three different copula-based spatial interpolation methods. By exploiting the relationship between bivariate copulas and indicator covariances, we present indicator kriging and disjunctive kriging. As a second method we present simple kriging of the rank-transformed data. The third method is a plug-in prediction and generalizes the frequently applied trans-Gaussian kriging. Finally, we report on the results obtained for the so-called Helicopter data set which contains extreme radioactivity measurements. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={This paper presents random field models with Gaussian or gamma univariate distributions and isofactorial bivariate distributions, constructed by composing two independent random fields: a directing function with stationary Gaussian increments and a stationary coding process with bivariate Gaussian or gamma distributions. Two variations are proposed, by considering a multivariate directing function and a coding process with a separable covariance, or by including drift components in the directing function. Iterative algorithms based on the Gibbs sampler allow one to condition the realizations of the substitution random fields to a set of data, while the inference of the model parameters relies on simple tools such as indicator variograms and variograms of different orders. A case study in polluted soil management is presented, for which a gamma model is used to quantify the risk that pollutant concentrations over remediation units exceed a given toxicity level.

abstract={A practical framework for generating cross correlated random fields with a specified marginal distribution function, an autocorrelation function and cross correlation coefficients is presented in the paper. The approach relies on well-known series expansion methods for simulation of a Gaussian random field. The proposed method requires all cross correlated fields over the domain to share an identical autocorrelation function and the cross correlation structure between each pair of simulated fields to be simply defined by a cross correlation coefficient. Such relations result in specific properties of eigenvectors of covariance matrices of discretized field over the domain. These properties are used to decompose the eigenproblem, which must normally be solved in computing the series expansion, into two smaller eigenproblems. Such a decomposition represents a significant reduction of computational effort. Non-Gaussian components of a multivariate random field are proposed to be simulated via memoryless transformation of underlying Gaussian random fields for which the Nataf model is employed to modify the correlation structure. In this method, the autocorrelation structure of each field is fulfilled exactly while the cross correlation is only approximated. The associated errors can be computed before performing simulations and it is shown that the errors happen only in the cross correlation between distant points and that they are negligibly small in practical situations. Some comments on available techniques for simulation of underlying random variables in connection with the accuracy of basic fields' statistics at a given sample size are made. For this purpose a simple error assessment procedure is presented. Simulated random fields can be used both for representation of spatially correlated properties of structure or random load in the stochastic finite element method (SFEM). An example of this application is related to size effect studies in the nonlinear fracture mechanics of concrete, and is used to illustrate the method. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Hybrid geostatistical prediction methods incorporate (i) spatially-explicit soil observations and exhaustive grids of ancillary environmental variables (e.g. derived from remote sensing), (ii) spatial autocorrelation, (iii) spatial covariation, and/or (iv) combinations of the above. In numerous studies of terrestrial soils it has been shown that hybrid geostatistical methods outperform univariate spatial and regression (aspatial) methods. However, hybrid methods have rarely been employed to predict soil properties in wetlands. In this study we used spectral data and derived indices from two remote sensors (Landsat ETM+ and ASTER), with different spatial resolutions, from different seasons, but with similar spectral range, ancillary environmental data, as well as floc and soil total phosphorus (TP) observations from 111 sites. The specific objective of our study was to evaluate the performance of aspatial methods (multivariate regressions - REG), univariate spatial (Ordinary Kriging - OK) and hybrid/multivariate geostatistical methods (Regression Kriging - RK and Co-kriging - CK) in predicting the spatial variability and distribution of floc and soil TP in a subtropical wetland, WCA-2A, in the Florida Everglades. Measured floc TP ranged from 194 to 1865 mg kg- 1 with a median of 751 mg kg- 1 and standard deviation (SD) of 381 mg kg- 1. According to cross-validation, predictions for floc TP based on the root mean square prediction error (RMSE) were best in the following order: RKquadratic (134.9) &gt; RKmultivariate (201.1) &gt; OK (206.1) &gt; CK (212.1) &gt; REGmultivariate (218.3) &gt; REGquadratic (220.3) &gt; REGlinear (264.4); and based on the mean prediction error (ME) followed the order RKmultivariate (0.9) ∼ RKquadratic (1.1) &gt; CK (- 6.7) &gt; REGmultivariate (18.2) &gt; REGlinear (25.1) &gt; OK (- 27.3) &gt; REGquadratic (27.3). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)-green derived from Landsat ETM+ showed the largest predictive power for floc TP. Measured soil TP ranged from 155 to 1702 mg kg- 1 with a median of 433 mg kg- 1 and standard deviation of 316 mg kg- 1. Predictions for soil TP based on RMSE were best in the following order: RKASTER (200.1) &gt; CKASTER (238.2) ∼ CKETM (239.0) &gt; OK (258.0) &gt; RKETM (279.2) &gt; REGASTER (281.8) &gt; REGETM (356.1); and based on ME followed the order: CKASTER (0.1) ∼ CKETM (0.2) &gt; RKASTER (- 5.2) &gt; RKETM (- 31.5) &gt; OK (- 41.8) &gt; REGASTER (94.4) &gt; REGETM (133.7). The NDVI showed the largest predictive power for soil TP. This comparative study in a subtropical wetland demonstrated the benefits of incorporating remote sensing data into floc and soil TP prediction models. Overall, hybrid geostatistical methods (CK and RK) performed better than regressions and spatial univariate models (OK) in the prediction of floc and soil TP. Depending on the strength of the spatial covariance between primary and secondary variables (CK) and the ability of the regression model in RK to explain the variability of a target variable (e.g., floc or soil TP), either CK or RK performed best. Our findings in this wetland confirmed results from earlier studies on terrestrial soils indicating the superior performance of hybrid geostatistical methods in predicting soil properties.},

abstract={Soil pollution data collection typically studies multivariate measurements at sampling locations, e.g., lead, zinc, copper or cadmium levels. With increased collection of such multivariate geostatistical spatial data, there arises the need for flexible explanatory stochastic models.Here, we propose a general constructive approach for building suitable models based upon convolution of covariance functions. We begin with a general theorem which asserts that, under weak conditions, cross convolution of covariance functions provides a valid cross covariance function.We also obtain a result on dependence induced by such convolution. Since, in general, convolution does not provide closed-form integration, we discuss efficient computation. We then suggest introducing such specification through a Gaussian process to model multivariate spatial random effects within a hierarchical model. We note that modeling spatial random effects in this way is parsimonious relative to say, the linear model of coregionalization. Through a limited simulation, we informally demonstrate that performance for these two specifications appears to be indistinguishable, encouraging the parsimonious choice. Finally, we use the convolved covariance model to analyze a trivariate pollution dataset from California. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.},

abstract={The simulation of spatially correlated Gaussian random fields is widespread in geologic, hydrologic and environmental applications for characterizing the uncertainty about the unsampled values of regionalized attributes. In this respect, the turning bands method has received attention among practitioners, for it allows multidimensional simulations to be generated at the CPU cost of one-dimensional simulations. This work provides and documents a set of computer programs for (i) constructing three-dimensional realizations of stationary and intrinsic Gaussian random fields, (ii) conditioning these realizations to a set of data and (iii) back-transforming the Gaussian values to the original attribute units. Such programs can deal with simulations over large domains and handle anisotropic and nested covariance models. The quality of the proposed programs is examined through an example consisting of a non-conditional simulation of a spherical covariance model. The artifact banding in the simulated maps is shown to be negligible when thousands of lines are used. The main parameters of the univariate and bivariate distributions, as well as their expected ergodic fluctuations, also prove to be accurately reproduced. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Groundwater quality parameters exhibit considerable spatial variability. Geostatistical methods including the assessment of variograms are usually used to characterize this variability. Copulas offer an interesting opportunity to describe dependence structures for multivariate distributions. Bivariate empirical copulas can be used as an alternative to variograms and covariance functions for the description of the spatial variability. Rank correlations of these copulas express the strength of the dependence independently of the marginal distributions and thus offer an alternative to the variograms. Empirical copulas for four quality parameters, chloride, sulfate, pH, and nitrate, obtained from a large-scale groundwater quality measurement network in Baden-Württemberg (Germany) are calculated. They indicate that the spatial dependence structure of the investigated parameters is not Gaussian. Two theoretical copula-based models are presented in this paper: a Gaussian and a non-Gaussian. Bootstrap-based statistical tests using stochastic simulation of the multivariate distributions are used to investigate the appropriateness of the models. According to the test results the Gaussian copula is rejected for most of the parameters while the non-Gaussian alternative is not rejected in most cases.

abstract={This article proposes a modeling framework for high-dimensional experimental data, such as brain images or microarrays, that discovers statistically significant structures most relevant to the experimental covariates. To deal with the curse of dimensionality, three regularization schemes are used: a reduced-rank model, penalization of the covariance matrix, and regularization of the basis-expanded predictor set. The latter allows us to flexibly model associations while controlling for overfitting. The modeling framework is derived from a reduced-rank multiresponse linear model, which offers a familiar interface for researchers. The novel regularizations of both sides of the model make it applicable in high-dimensional settings, without a need for prior dimension reduction, and can model nonlinear relationships. An efficient, dual-space algorithm is proposed to estimate its components in low-dimensional space. It permits the use of the bootstrap, to provide pointwise standard error bands on association graphs, and other resampling techniques to optimize hyperparameters. We evaluate the model on a small neuroimaging dataset, and in a simulation study using simple images corrupted by additive Gaussian iid and random field noise components with signal-to-noise ratios below 0.1. Our model compares well with a general linear model (GLM) even when the nonlinear associations are specified explicitly in GLM. ©2006 American Statistical Association, Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and Interface Foundation of North America.},

abstract={Hydrologic and ecologic studies in mountainous terrain are sensitive to the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation. In this study a geostatistical model, Auto-Searched Orographic and Atmospheric Effects Detrended Kriging (ASOADeK), is introduced to map mountain precipitation using only precipitation gauge data. The ASOADeK model considers both precipitation spatial covariance and orographic and atmospheric effects in estimating precipitation distribution. The model employs gauge data and a multivariate linear regression approach to autosearch regional and local climatic settings (i.e., infer the spatial gradient in atmospheric moisture distribution and the effective moisture flux direction), and local orographic effects (the effective terrain elevation and aspect). The observed gauge precipitation data are then spatially detrended by the autosearched regression surface. The spatially detrended gauge data are further interpolated by ordinary kriging to generate a residual precipitation surface. The precipitation map is then constructed by adding the regression surface to the kriged residual surface. The ASOADeK model was applied to map monthly precipitation for a mountainous area in semiarid northern New Mexico. The effective moisture flux directions and spatial moisture trends identified by the optimal multiple linear regressions, using only gauge data, agree with the regional climate setting. When compared to a common precipitation mapping product [Precipitation-elevation Regression on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM)], the ASOADeK summer precipitation maps of the study area agree well with the PRISM estimates, and with higher spatial resolution. The ASOADeK winter maps improve upon PRISM estimates. ASOADeK gives better estimates than precipitation kriging and precipitation-elevation cokriging because it considers orographic and atmospheric effects more completely. © 2005 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract={The profitability of a cement plant depends largely on its capacity to produce homogeneous cement with chemical composition close to specified targets for the cement type produced. One crucial step is the mixing of limestone with other raw materials in proportions calculated to meet these targets. Major design and operation decisions depend on the efficiency of this homogenizing step. The adequate modeling of the mixing process requires simulation of representative cross-correlated time series of chemical compositions of the raw materials involved. The chemical composition signals are obtained by multivariate geostatistical simulation using an LU (Cholesky) decomposition of the covariance matrix. Modifications to the usual LU method are presented. First, the effect on the raw covariance matrix of the closure property of chemical analysis is imposed. Second, the problem of memory space limitations in the LU method is tackled by using overlapping sliding neighbourhoods. The simulation algorithm is applied to the Joppa cement plant owned by Lafarge North America. The simulated raw material input streams are fed into the quality mix control (QMC), a proprietary software that models and controls the mixing operation to produce an output stream with cement characteristics as close as possible to desired targets. Two signal series are studied, one autocorrelated with a moderate temporal range and one with no autocorrelation. The QMC produces C3S output signals having comparable short scale periodic variograms except that the variance of the uncorrelated signal is four times greater than those of the autocorrelated signal and the real Joppa data. The raw material feeder variograms have the same sill for both the white noise and the autocorrelated signals. However, the autocorrelated signal feeder variogram presents lower short term dispersion variance, a characteristic feature of Joppa operations. Our results show the importance of simulating the right temporal structure of the raw materials to realistically forecast the behavior of the output signals. We also discuss some practical implications of these findings for the design and operation of a cement plant. © Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2005.},

abstract={Marginal additive hazards models are considered for multivariate survival data in which individuals may experience events of several types and there may also be correlation between individuals. Estimators are proposed for the parameters of such models and for the baseline hazard functions. The estimators of the regression coeffcients are shown asymptotically to follow a multivariate normal distribution with a sandwich-type covariance matrix that can be consistently estimated. The estimated baseline and subject-specific cumulative hazard processes are shown to converge weakly to a zero-mean Gaussian random field. The weak convergence properties for the corresponding survival processes are established. A resampling technique is proposed for constructing simultaneous confidence bands for the survival curve of a specific subject. The methodology is extended to a multivariate version of a class of partly parametric additive hazards model. Simulation studies are conducted to assess finite sample properties, and the method is illustrated with an application to development of coronary heart diseases and cardiovascular accidents in the Framingham Heart Study. © 2004 Biometrika Trust.},

abstract={Although modeling of cross-covariances by fitting the linear model of coregionalization (LMC) is considered a cumbersome task, cross-covariances are the key for integration of data for multiple attributes in environmental hydrology, aquifer and reservoir characterizations using multivariate geostatistics. This paper proposes a novel method of modeling cross-covariances in the linear model of coregionalization (LMC). The classic minimum/maximum autocorrelation factors (MAF) method is analyzed and found to be a good tool to discriminate the elementary nested structures of directional sample covariance matrices. Thus, separate modeling of the scalar sample covariance for each MAF factor may allow to obtain the complete LMC model for the original attributes after a back rotation of the diagonal model covariance matrix of directional factors. However, such a back rotation is not computable following the classic MAF formulation. This paper introduces an ambirotational minimum/maximum autocorrelation factors (AMAF) method that allows a back and forth double rotation of the directional diagonal model covariance matrix for factors. This approach provides a device for modeling of the full matrix of directional covariance and cross-covariance for the original attributes in the LMC without recurring to iterations. In this way, the use of multivariate geostatistics for data integration is allowed avoiding collocated approaches or rotation and modeling of data factor scores. The method is illustrated with an example for covariances for three attributes. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

The CC are independent random fields with covariance models obtained from projections and conditioning in the frequency domain. The approach is to simulate one attribute in the physical space and use the results to estimate the other attributes in the frequency domain. Then, a CC for the next attribute is simulated and projected on the other attributes. In general, any attribute is built as the sum of inverse Fourier transform of the orthogonal projection of previous simulated CC plus a last CC simulated in the physical space. This simulation approach continues in this fashion for several attributes and the order of them may be changed for different realizations. This method allows for data conditioning and simulation. A simplified version for intrinsically correlated random fields allows for an approach that avoids the frequency domain.},

abstract={Spatial structure in plant communities occurs in the forms of (1) single-species aggregation and dispersion patterns, (2) distance-dependent interactions between species, and (3) the response to the spatial structure of environmental conditions. Different methods deal with these components of spatial variation: geostatistical analysis reveals autocorrelation in a spatial sample; the variance of species richness has been used as an indicator for interspecific interactions due to niche limitation; and ordination techniques describe multispecies responses to environmental factors. Based on the mathematical properties of presence - absence data, it is shown how variogram modeling, the testing of interspecific associations, and multiscale ordination can be integrated using the same set of distance-dependent variance - covariance matrices (variogram matrix). The varlogram matrix partitions the variance of community data into spatial components at the levels of the individual species, species composition, and species richness. It can be used to factor out the effects of single-species aggregation patterns, interspecific interactions, or environmental heterogeneity. The mathematical integration of traditionally unrelated methods increases the interpretability of variograms of plant communities, provides a spatial extension and an empirical null model for the variance test of species richness, and extends multiscale ordination to nonsystematic spatial samples. Beyond the individual applications, the variogram matrix provides a framework for a mathematical unification of geostatistics, multivariate data analysis, and the analysis of variance that may enable ecologists from a broad range of fields to incorporate spatial effects into their research and to integrate analyses across different levels of biological organization.},

abstract={If we wish to describe the coregionalization of two or more soil properties for estimation by cokriging then we must estimate and model their auto- and cross-variogram(s). The conventional estimates of these variograms, obtained by the method-of-moments, are unduly affected by outlying data which inflate the variograms and so also the estimates of the error variance of cokriging predictions. Robust estimators are less affected. Robust estimators of the auto-variogram and the pseudo cross-variogram have previously been proposed and used successfully, but the multivariate problem of estimating the cross-variogram robustly has not yet been tackled. Two robust estimators of the cross-variogram are proposed. These use covariance estimators with good robustness properties. The robust estimators of the cross-variogram proved more resistant to outliers than did the method-of-moments estimator when applied to simulated fields which were then contaminated. Organic carbon and water content of the soil was measured at 256 sites on a transect and the method-of-moments estimator, and the two robust estimators, were used to estimate the auto-variograms and cross-variogram from a prediction subset of 156 sites. The data on organic carbon included a few outliers. The method-of-moments estimator returned larger values of the auto- and cross-variograms than did either robust estimator. The organic carbon content at the 100 validation sites on the transect was estimated by cokriging from the prediction data plus a set of variograms fitted to the method-of-moments estimates and two sets of variograms fitted to the robust estimates. The ratio of the actual squared prediction error to the cokriging estimate of the error variance was computed at each validation site. These results showed that cokriging using variograms obtained by the method-of-moments estimator overestimated the error variance of the predictions. By contrast, cokriging with the robustly estimated variograms gave reliable estimates of the error variance of the predictions.},

abstract={Over the past 10 years, fisheries scientists gradually adopted geostatistical tools when analysing fish stock survey data for estimating population abundance. First, the relation between model-based variance estimates and covariance structure enabled estimation of survey precision for non-random survey designs. The possibility of using spatial covariance for optimising sampling strategy has been a second motive for using geostatistics. Kriging also offers the advantage of weighting data values, which is useful when sample points are clustered. This paper discusses, with fisheries applications, the different geostatistical models that characterise spatial variation, and their variance formulate for many different survey designs. Some anticipated developments of geostatistics related to multivariate structures, temporal variability and adaptive sampling are discussed.},

abstract={During the past decade, the Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) approach has been used with considerable success in a variety of geostatistical applications, including the spatiotemporal analysis and estimation of multivariate distributions. In this work, we investigate methods for calculating the space/time moments of such distributions that occur in BME mapping applications, and we propose general expressions for non-Gaussian model densities based on Gaussian averages. Two explicit approximations for the covariance are derived, one based on leading-order perturbation analysis and the other on the diagrammatic method. The leading-order estimator is accurate only for weakly non-Gaussian densities. The diagrammatic estimator includes higher-order terms and is accurate for larger non-Gaussian deviations. We also formulate general expressions for Monte Carlo moment calculations including precision estimates. A numerical algorithm based on importance sampling is developed, which is computationally efficient for multivariate probability densities with a large number of points in space/time. We also investigate the BME moment problem, which consists in determining the general knowledge-based BME density from experimental measurements. In the case of multivariate densities, this problem requires solving a system of nonlinear integral equations. We refomulate the system of equations as an optimization problem, which we then solve numerically for a symmetric univariate pdf. Finally, we discuss theoretical and numerical issues related to multivariate BME solutions. © 2001 International Association for Mathematical Geology.},

abstract={Assessment of the sampling variance of the experimental variogram is an important topic in geostatistics as it gives the uncertainty of the variogram estimates. This assessment, however, is repeatedly overlooked in most applications mainly, perhaps, because a general approach has not been implemented in the most commonly used software packages for variogram analysis. In this paper the authors propose a solution that can be implemented easily in a computer program, and which, subject to certain assumptions, is exact. These assumptions are not very restrictive: second-order stationarity (the process has a finite variance and the variogram has a sill) and, solely for the purpose of evaluating fourth-order moments, a Gaussian distribution for the random function. The approach described here gives the variance-covariance matrix of the experimental variogram, which takes into account not only the correlation among the experiemental values but also the multiple use of data in the variogram computation. Among other applications, standard errors may be attached to the variogram estimates and the variance-covariance matrix may be used for fitting a theoretical model by weighted, or by generalized, least squares. Confidence regions that hold a given confidence level for all the variogram lag estimates simultaneously have been calculated using the Bonferroni method for rectangular intervals, and using the multivariate Gaussian assumption for K-dimensional elliptical intervals (where K is the number of experimental variogram estimates). A general approach for incorporating the uncertainty of the experimental variogram into the uncertainty of the variogram model parameters is also shown. A case study with rainfall data is used to illustrate the proposed approach. © 2001 International Association for Mathematical Geology.},

Such data, denoted by Y(si,sj) for the pair si,sj is customarily referred to as spatial interaction data. We adopt a much broader view of such data but still seek a geostatistical modelling framework.

Our approach is to introduce a hierarchical model capturing spatial interaction at the second stage using a bivariate Gaussian spatial process. Very flexible classes of models result.

abstract={Soil information related to a region may only be available in aggregated form (e.g., a physical average value from bulked sampling or a mean value for a land facet or similar map unit). When this information is to be used as input to a model that describes processes in smaller units (e.g., the pedon) then it must be disaggregated to an appropriate scale. It is shown how the sectioning method of Addiscott and Wagenet [Addiscott, T.M., Wagenet, R.J., 1985. A simple method for combining soil properties that show variability. Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 49, 1365-1369] may be used for this purpose. The sectioning method is extended by using a (univariate or multivariate) linear model of (co)regionalisation of the variables to compute the variances and covariances of disaggregated soil properties. It is shown how the eigenvectors of the disaggregated covariance matrix can be used to compute equiprobable sections for correlated soil properties. The methods are demonstrated using the SLIM model, a functional model of leaching. The results obtained are comparable to those from Monte Carlo analysis, and emphasise the importance of accounting for the spatial variability that underlies aggregated soil information. It is proposed that cost-effective spatial sampling to determine variograms of soil properties and/or the use of average variograms from comparable regions could provide the information to make this a practicable method for disaggregating soil information for practical problems.

abstract={This paper extends the concept of dispersion variance to the multivariate case where the change of support affects dispersion covariances and the matrix of correlation between attributes. This leads to a concept of correlation between attributes as a function of sample supports and size of the physical domain. Decomposition of dispersion covariances into the spatial scales of variability provides a tool for computing the contribution to variability from different spatial components. Coregionalized dispersion covariances and elementary dispersion variances are defined for each multivariate spatial scale of variability. This allows the computation of dispersion covariances and correlation between attributes without integrating the cross-variograms. A correlation matrix, for a second-order stationary field with point support and infinite domain, converges toward constant correlation coefficients. The regionalized correlation coefficients for each spatial scale of variability, and the cases where the intrinsic correlation hypothesis holds are found independent of support and size of domain. This approach opens possibilities for multivariate geostatistics with data taken at different support. Two numerical examples from soil textural data demonstrate the change of correlation matrix with the size of the domain. In general, correlation between attributes is extended from the classic Pearson correlation coefficient based on independent samples to a most general approach for dependent samples taken with different support in a limited domain.},

abstract={This paper introduces global shape modeling by means of Markov random fields and describes its use in medical image segmentation. The key point positions representing the shape of an object are assumed to be multivariate Gaussian distributed with a certain covariance structure which relates to the Markov property with respect to some neighborhood system. Since the neighborhood of a key point potentially contains both nearby and long distant key points, global key point interaction is not only realized by propagated local key point interaction, but also directly by long distant key point interaction. We restrict ourselves to the subclass of decomposable models, since a closed form expression for the maximum likelihood estimate of the covariance matrix from a set of training shapes is available in this case. The neighborhood system is either a priori defined or estimated. Our model building procedure is demonstrated for the 2D shape of spinal vertebra. The suitability of the derived shape models is investigated by generating new shape samples according to the models. Finding the object's boundary in a grey value image is formulated as maximum a posteriori estimation incorporating the shape model as a priori model. Our model-based segmentation procedure includes an easy and effective interactive improvement of the segmentation outcome.},

abstract={It is often convenient to use synthetically generated random fields to study the hydrologic effects of spatial heterogeneity. Although there are many ways to produce such fields, spectral techniques are particularly attractive because they are fast and conceptually straightforward. This paper describes a spectral algorithm for generating sets of random fields which are correlated with one another. The algorithm is based on a discrete version of the Fourier-Stieltjes representation for multidimensional random fields. The Fourier increment used in this representation depends on a random phase angle process and a complex-valued spectral factor matrix which can be readily derived from a specified set of cross-spectral densities (or cross-covariances). The inverse Fourier transform of the Fourier increment is a complex random field with real and imaginary parts which each have the desired coveriance structure. Our complex-valued spectral formulation provides an especially convenient way to generate a set of random fields which all depend on a single underlying (independent) field, provided that the fields in question can be related by space-invariant linear transformations. We illustrate this by generating multi-dimensional mass conservative groundwater velocity fields which can be used to simulate solute transport through heterogeneous anisotropic porous media. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract={In this paper, the maximum likelihood method for inferring the parameters of spatial covariances is examined. The advantages of the maximum likelihood estimation are discussed and it is shown that this method, derived assuming a multivariate Gaussian distribution for the data, gives a sound criterion of fitting covariance models irrespective of the multivariate distribution of the data. However, this distribution is impossible to verify in practice when only one realization of the random function is available. Then, the maximum entropy method is the only sound criterion of assigning probabilities in absence of information. Because the multivariate Gaussian distribution has the maximum entropy property for a fixed vector of means and covariance matrix, the multinormal distribution is the most logical choice as a default distribution for the experimental data. Nevertheless, it should be clear that the assumption of a multivariate Gaussian distribution is maintained only for the inference of spatial covariance parameters and not necessarily for other operations such as spatial interpolation, simulation or estimation of spatial distributions. Various results from simulations are presented to support the claim that the simultaneous use of maximum likelihood method and the classical nonparametric method of moments can considerably improve results in the estimation of geostatistical parameters.},

abstract={Accurate interpolation of soil and climate variables at fine spatial scales is necessary for precise field management. Interpolation is needed to produce the input variables necessary for crop modelling. It is also important when deciding on regulations to limit environmental impacts from processes such as nitrate leaching. Non-stationarity may arise due to many factors, including differences in soil type, or heterogeneity in chemical concentrations. Many geostatistical methods make stationarity assumptions. Substantial improvements in interpolation or in the estimation of standard errors may be obtained by using non-stationary models of spatial covariances. This paper presents recent methodological developments for an approach to modelling non-stationary spatial covariance structure through deformations of the geographic coordinate system. This approach was first introduced by Sampson & Guttorp, although the estimation approach is updated in more recent papers. They compute a deformation of the geographic plane so that the spatial covariance structure can be considered stationary in terms of a new spatial coordinate system. This provides a non-stationary model for the spatial covariances between sampled locations and prediction locations. In this paper, we present a cross-validation procedure to avoid over-fitting of the sample dispersions. Results concerning the variability of the spatial covariance estimates are also presented. An example of the modelling of the spatial correlation field of rainfall at small regional scale is presented. Other directions in methodological development, including modelling temporally varying spatial correlation, and approaches to model temporal and spatial correlation are mentioned. Future directions for methodological development are indicated, including the modelling of multivariate processes and the use of external spatially dense covariables. Such covariates are frequently available in precision agriculture.},

This paper shows that for many important correlation functions in geostatistics, realizations of the associated process over m + 1 equispaced points on a line can be produced at the cost of an initial FFT of length 2m with each new realization requiring an additional FFT of the same length. In particular, the paper first notes that if an (m+1) × (m+1) Toeplitz correlation matrix R can be embedded in a nonnegative definite 2M × 2M circulant matrix S, exact realizations of the normal multivariate y ∼ N/(0, R) can be generated via FFTs of length 2M. Theoretical results are then presented to demonstrate that for many commonly used correlation structures the minimal embedding in which M = m is nonnegative definite. Extensions to simulations of stationary fields in higher dimensions are also provided and illustrated.},

abstract={The numerical stability of linear systems arising in kriging, estimation, and simulation of random fields, is studied analytically and numerically. In the state-space formulation of kriging, as developed here, the stability of the kriging system depends on the condition number of the prior, stationary covariance matrix. The same is true for conditional random field generation by the superposition method, which is based on kriging, and the multivariate Gaussian method, which requires factoring a covariance matrix. A large condition number corresponds to an ill-conditioned, numerically unstable system. In the case of stationary covariance matrices and uniform grids, as occurs in kriging of uniformly sampled data, the degree of ill-conditioning generally increases indefinitely with sampling density and, to a limit, with domain size. The precise behavior is, however, highly sensitive to the underlying covariance model. Detailed analytical and numerical results are given for five one-dimensional covariance models: (1) hole-exponential, (2) exponential, (3) linear-exponential, (4) hole-Gaussian, and (5) Gaussian. This list reflects an approximate ranking of the models, from "best" to "worst" conditioned. The methods developed in this work can be used to analyze other covariance models. Examples of such representative analyses, conducted in this work, include the spherical and periodic hole-effect (hole-sinusoidal) covariance models. The effect of small-scale variability (nugget) is addressed and extensions to irregular sampling schemes and higher dimensional spaces are discussed. © 1994 International Association for Mathematical Geology.},

The theory presented here permits temporal (and spatial) modeling to be done in a convenient and flexible way. At the same time model misspecifications, if any, can be corrected by additional data if and when it becomes available, and past data may be used in a systematic way to fit model parameters. Finally, uncertainty about model parameters is represented in the (posterior) distributions, so unrealistically small credible regions for the interpolants are avoided. The theory is based on the multivariate normal and related distributions, but because of the hierarchical prior models adopted, the results would seem somewhat robust with respect to the choice of these distributions and associated hyperparameters. © 1992.},

abstract={A multivariate geostatistical technique is presented to address two key issues of trend detection and network evaluation of acid deposition data. The proposed technique is specifically designed to be compatible with the distinctive characteristics of acid deposition variables such as non-stationary of their spatial means, non-stationary of their spatial covariances, their complex periodic and non-periodic temporal trends, and the common imbalance between the availability of their spatial and temporal data. To accomplish this, the time series at each measurement point is viewed as a separate, but correlated one-dimensional regionalized variable. Each variable is assumed to be a sum of periodic (e.g. seasonal) and non-periodic (e.g. anthropogenic) temporal random variables, each characterized by its own temporal variogram. To obtain an initial estimate of the frequency of the involved periodic trends, direct quadratic spectrum estimation is conducted. Based on fitted direct and cross variograms, various forms of estimation such as co-kriging of non-periodic components can be performed. The estimated time series may then be tested for the presence of long-term trends. In addition, the fitted sill values of any variogram model at different stations form elements of a coregionalization matrix. This matrix may be regarded as the variance-covariance matrix for the particular temporal-trend scale presented by the variogram model. A coregionalization matrix can be used to generate a spatial correlogram. Viewing the estimated integral scale of each spatial correlogram as an indicator of the radius of information-influence of each measurement station, a monitoring network can be evaluated for its adequacy of coverage at different temporal-trend scales. A coregionalization matrix can also be decomposed through principal-component analysis in order to determine any potential spatial groupings and/or to generate regional indicators of changes at different temporal scales. © 1992.},

abstract={Most studies of relations between soil properties fail to take account of their regionalized nature because of the lack of appropriate methods. This paper describes a geostatistical technique, factorial kriging analysis, that bridges the gap between classical multivariate analysis and a univariate geostatistical approach. The basic feature of the method is the fitting of a linear model of coregionalization, i.e. all experimental simple and cross‐variograms are modelled with a linear combination of basic variogram functions. A particular variance‐covariance matrix, the coregionalization matrix, can then be associated with each spatial scale defined by the range of the basic variogram function. Each coregionalization matrix describes relationships between variables at a given spatial scale. A principal component analysis of these matrices produces a set of components, the regionalized factors, that reflect the main features of the multivariate information for each spatial scale and whose scores are estimated by cokriging. The technique is described and illustrated with three case studies based on a simulated data set and soil survey data. The results are compared with those of the principal component analysis of the variance‐covariance matrix and the variogram matrices. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

abstract={Stochastic process theory involves integrals of measurable functions over probability measure spaces. One of these is the ensemble space, Ω, whose members are sample functions on Euclidean space Rk and the other is Rk itself. What geostatisticians call the "theory of regionalized variables" is said to based on stochastic theory. A recent paper in Mathematical Geology proclaims a distinction between "probabilistic" and "deterministic" geostatistics. The former is said to rely on "ensemble integrals" over Ω and the latter on "spatial integrals" over Rk. This study shows that the proposed distinction rests on an arbitrary choice between two estimators for the covariance of a stochastic process; neither is an ensemble integral, both are spatial integrals, and both are Kolmogorov inconsistent. The "deterministic" estimator is identical with that of classical bivariate least-squares regression in which "spatial structure" is of no consequence. This study shows that both stochastic models are suboptimal approximations to the unique nonstationary classical statistical multivariate regression model generated by each sample pattern. The stochastic process model and its "spatial continuity measures," thus, appear as questionable mathematical embellishments on suboptimal estimates, correspondence with geomorphic reality is tenuous, and estimates are biased and distorted. Various related misconceptions in the paper are also discussed. © 1991 International Association for Mathematical Geology.},

abstract={An analog method is used to simulate a discrete transmissivity field free of the artifacts inherent in conventional multivariate Gaussian statistical generation methods. The simulated field provides a realistic model of a formation exhibiting the spatial continuity of extreme transmissivities which gives rise to barriers and preferential channels for flow. The heterogeneous transmissivity field and the corresponding steady‐state head and discharge fields are characterized in a geostatistical framework and observed spatial statistics are compared with theoretical results from the stochastic hydrogeology literature. The simulated transmissivity field exhibits a bimodal distribution and strong directional anisotropy with nested scales of heterogeneity. Despite these significant departures from standard models, the observed head covariance and head‐log‐transmissivity cross‐covariance agree well with theory. The spatial covariance of specific discharge is highly anisotropic reflecting preferential channeling in the mean direction of flow and the conservation of flux along streamlines. The effective transmissivity of the field is predicted more accurately by the spatial geometric average than by theoretical models despite the flow channeling and the anisotropy of heterogeneity. Tracer spreading, modeled by particle tracking, is non‐Fickian at displacements of up to 13.4 times the log‐transmissivity integral range because transport behavior is dominated by convection along a small number of preferential channels. The observed scale dependence of apparent longitudinal dispersivity is predicted generally well by theory. Results of this study suggest that ensemble theoretical models based on perturbation approaches can provide reasonable estimates of general flow and transport properties of single field realizations under moderate conditions of heterogeneity.

abstract={Geostatistical simulation is used to create a synthetic three-dimensional geologic environment such that randomly generated values of a physical property have a required covariance and mean. We create a spatially stationary, multivariate Gaussian simulation with a Gaussian covariance. This type of simulation permits modelling of natural variations which may be an important source of noise in geologic investigations. Computationally efficient frequency-domain methods allow the rapid creation of multiple scenarios, each having the required statistical distribution. For the particular problem considered, a given porosity distribution is simulated and then functionally related to physical properties needed for input into geophysical models. Additionally, megascopic cavities having random size, shape, and orientation similar to those observed in karst settings are emplaced in the physical model. -from Authors},

abstract={The space domain version of the turning bands method can simulate multidimensional stochastic processes (random fields) having particular forms of covariance functions. To alleviate this limitation a spectral representation of the turning bands method in the two-dimensional case has shown that the spectral approach allows simulation of isotropic two-dimensional processes having any covariance or spectral density function. The present paper extends the spectral turning bands method (STBM) even further for simulation of much more general classes of multidimensional stochastic processes. Particular extensions include: (i) simulation of three-dimensional processes using STBM, (ii) simulation of anisotropic two- or three-dimensional stochastic processes, (iii) simulation of multivariate stochastic processes, and (iv) simulation of spatial averaged (integrated) processes. The turning bands method transforms the multidimensional simulation problem into a sum of a series of one-dimensional simulations. Explicit and simple expressions relating the cross-spectral density functions of the one-dimensional processes to the cross-spectral density function of the multidimensional process are derived. Using such expressions the one-dimensional processes can be simulated using a simple one-dimensional spectral method. Examples illustrating that the spectral turning bands method preserves the theoretical statistics are presented. The spectral turning bands method is inexpensive in terms of computer time compared to other multidimensional simulation methods. In fact, the cost of the turning bands method grows as the square root or the cubic root of the number of points simulated in the discretized random field, in the two- or three-dimensional case, respectively, whereas the cost of other multidimensional methods grows linearly with the number of simulated points. The spectral turning bands method currently is being used in hydrologic applications. This method is also applicable to other fields where multidimensional simulations are needed, e.g., mining, oil reservoir modeling, geophysics, remote sensing, etc. © 1987 International Association for Mathematical Geology.},
