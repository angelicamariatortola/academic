Title = {{Twenty-two families of multivariate covariance kernels on spheres, with
   their spectral representations and sufficient validity conditions}},
Journal = {{STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT}},
Abstract = {{The modeling of real-valued random fields indexed by spherical
   coordinates arises in different disciplines of the natural sciences,
   especially in environmental, atmospheric and earth sciences. However,
   there is currently a lack of parametric models allowing a flexible
   representation of the spatial correlation structure of multivariate data
   located on a spherical surface. To bridge this gap, we provide
   analytical expressions of twenty-two parametric families of isotropic
   p-variate covariance kernels on the d-dimensional sphere, defined for
   any integers p > 0 and d > 1, together with their respective spectral
   representations (Schoenberg matrices) and sufficient validity conditions
   on the covariance parameters. These families include multiquadric, sine
   power, exponential, Bessel and hypergeometric kernels, and provide
   covariances exhibiting varied shapes, short-scale and large-scale
   behaviors. Our construction relies on the so-called multivariate
   parametric adaptation approach, where a matrix-valued covariance kernel
   is defined on the basis of a scalar covariance to which matrix-valued
   parameters are applied, coupled with matrix manipulations.}},

Title = {{Decomposition of multivariate spatial data into latent factors}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{153}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Simulating spatial Gaussian realizations is one of the core components
   of geostatistics and numerous other fields involving uncertainty, risk,
   and reliability. The use of decorrelation methods and truncated Gaussian
   algorithms further promotes the use of Gaussian realizations. In
   multivariate cases, geological variables may represent different scales
   and exhibit different spatial structures and anisotropy that complicates
   decorrelation methods. For cases where spatial dependencies cannot be
   removed using techniques such as the projection pursuit multivariate
   transform coupled with maximum autocorrelation factors, cokriging is
   advocated and requires a model of coregionalization. However, blind
   source separation represents the original multivariate problem as a
   linear combination of latent source variables, each one having a spatial
   structure from the linear model of coregionalization (LMC). The latent
   source variables or factors are independent and follow a standard normal
   distribution facilitating the use of Gaussian simulation algorithms.
   Moreover, different algorithms may be utilized for each variable given
   that some are more efficient at generating realizations for different
   spatial covariance functions. Recovering the original variables
   afterwards is straightforward. The theory for this decomposition is
   presented. A small numerical example is used to explain the theory and
   the proposed approach is illustrated through a case study with
   geochemical sample data.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces the K-combined vector random field, whose
   finite-dimensional characteristic functions are made up of certain power
   functions and whose finite-dimensional density functions are comprised

   finite-dimensional distributions may have heavy tails or thin tails,
   comparing with a Gaussian one, and thus it provides a potential model

Title = {{A unified skew-normal geostatistical factor model}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMETRICS}},
Year = {{2021}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The classical linear model of coregionalization and its simpler
   counterpart known as the proportional covariance model, or intrinsic
   correlation model, have become standard tools in many areas of
   application for the analysis of multivariate spatial data. Despite the
   merits of this model, it guarantees optimal predictions only in the case
   of Gaussian data and can lead to erroneous conclusions in all other
   circumstances, in particular in the presence of skew data. To deal with
   multivariate geostatistical data showing some degree of skewness, this
   article proposes a latent spatial factor model in which all
   finite-dimensional marginal distributions are multivariate unified
   skew-normal. For this model, we can write the log-likelihood function of
   the data and implement a maximum likelihood estimation procedure which
   enables the simultaneous estimation of all parameters of the model.
   Moreover, we also show how the computational burden involved in the
   nonlinear mapping of the latent factors can be substantially reduced by
   exploiting a linearity property of the predictions. The sampling
   performances of the inferential procedures are investigated in some
   thorough simulation studies, and an application to radioactive
   contamination data is presented to show the flexibility of the model.
   Detailed derivations of our results are available as Supplementary
   Material.}},

   normal and Student-t probabilities}},
Journal = {{STATISTICS AND COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 12}},
Abstract = {{We present a preconditioned Monte Carlo method for computing
   high-dimensional multivariate normal and Student-t probabilities arising
   in spatial statistics. The approach combines a tile-low-rank
   representation of covariance matrices with a block-reordering scheme for
   efficient quasi-Monte Carlo simulation. The tile-low-rank representation
   decomposes the high-dimensional problem into many diagonal-block-size
   problems and low-rank connections. The block-reordering scheme reorders
   between and within the diagonal blocks to reduce the impact of
   integration variables from right to left, thus improving the Monte Carlo
   convergence rate. Simulations up to dimension 65,536 suggest that the
   new method can improve the run time by an order of magnitude compared
   with the hierarchical quasi-Monte Carlo method and two orders of
   magnitude compared with the dense quasi-Monte Carlo method. Our method
   also forms a strong substitute for the approximate conditioning methods
   as a more robust estimation with error guarantees. An application study
   to wind stochastic generators is provided to illustrate that the new
   computational method makes the maximum likelihood estimation feasible
   for high-dimensional skew-normal random fields.}},

Abstract = {{We study multivariate Gaussian random fields defined over d-dimensional

   modeling and inference on matrix-valued covariance functions. We
   determine the support (under the topology of uniform convergence) of the

   geodesically isotropic covariance functions on spheres. We provide a
   thorough inspection of the properties of the proposed model in terms of
   (a) first moments, (b) posterior distributions, and (c) Lipschitz
   continuities. We then provide an approximation method for multivariate
   fields on the sphere for which measures of L-p accuracy are established.
   Our findings are supported through simulation studies that show the rate
   of convergence when truncating a spectral expansion of a multivariate
   random field at a finite order. To illustrate the modeling framework

Abstract = {{Multivariate disease mapping models are attracting considerable
   attention. Many modeling proposals have been made in this area, which
   could be grouped into three large sets: coregionalization, multivariate
   conditional and univariate conditional models. In this work we establish
   some links between these three groups of proposals. Specifically, we
   explore the equivalence between the two conditional approaches and show
   that an important class of coregionalization models can be seen as a
   large subclass of the conditional approaches. Additionally, we propose
   an extension to the current set of coregionalization models with some
   new unexplored proposals. This extension is able to reproduce asymmetric
   cross-spatial covariances for different diseases. This shows that the
   previously accepted belief that coregionalization was not able to
   reproduce models with asymmetric cross-covariances was wrong. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{Modeling a mineral microstructure accurately in three dimensions can
   render realistic mineralogical patterns which can be used for
   three-dimensional processing simulations and calculation of
   three-dimensional mineral quantities. The present study introduces a
   flexible approach to model the microstructure of mineral material
   composed of a large number of facies. The common plurigaussian method, a
   valuable approach in geostatistics, can account for correlations within
   each facies and in principle be extended to correlations between the
   facies. Assuming stationarity and isotropy, founded on a new description
   of this model, formulas for first- and second-order characteristics,
   such as volume fraction, correlation function and cross-correlation
   function can be given by a multivariate normal distribution. In this
   particular situation, based on first- and second-order statistics, a
   fitting procedure can be developed which requires only numerical
   inversion of several one-dimensional monotone functions. The paper
   describes the whole workflow. The covariance structure is quickly

Abstract = {{The geostatistical analysis of multivariate spatial data for inference
   as well as joint predictions (co-kriging) ordinarily relies on modeling
   of the marginal and cross-covariance functions. While the former
   quantifies the spatial dependence within variables, the latter
   quantifies the spatial dependence across distinct variables. The
   marginal covariance functions are always symmetric; however, the
   cross-covariance functions often exhibit asymmetries in the real data.
   Asymmetric cross-covariance implies change in the value of
   cross-covariance for interchanged locations on fixed order of variables.
   Such change of cross-covariance values is often caused due to the
   spatial delay in effect of the response of one variable on another
   variable. These spatial delays are common in environmental processes,
   especially when dynamic phenomena such as prevailing wind and ocean
   currents are involved. Here, we propose a novel approach to introduce
   flexible asymmetries in the cross-covariances of stationary multivariate
   covariance functions. The proposed approach involves modeling the phase
   component of the constrained cross-spectral features to allow for
   asymmetric cross-covariances. We show the capability of our proposed
   model to recover the cross-dependence structure and improve spatial
   predictions against traditionally used models through multiple
   simulation studies. Additionally, we illustrate our approach on a real
   trivariate dataset of particulate matter concentration (PM2.5), wind
   speed and relative humidity. The real data example shows that our
   approach outperforms the traditionally used models, in terms of model
   fit and spatial predictions.

Abstract = {{The prevalence of spatially referenced multivariate data has impelled
   researchers to develop procedures for joint modeling of multiple spatial
   processes. This ordinarily involves modeling marginal and cross-process
   dependence for any arbitrary pair of locations using a multivariate
   spatial covariance function. However, building a flexible multivariate
   spatial covariance function that is nonnegative definite is challenging.
   Here, we propose a semiparametric approach for multivariate spatial
   covariance function estimation with approximate Matern marginals and
   highly flexible cross-covariance functions via their spectral
   representations. The flexibility in our cross-covariance function arises
   due to B-spline-based specification of the underlying coherence
   functions, which in turn allows us to capture nontrivial cross-spectral
   features. We then develop a likelihood-based estimation procedure and
   perform multiple simulation studies to demonstrate the performance of
   our method, especially on the coherence function estimation. Finally, we
   analyze particulate matter concentrations (PM2.5) and wind speed data
   over the West-North-Central climatic region of the United States, where
   we illustrate that our proposed method outperforms the commonly used
   full bivariate Matern model and the linear model of coregionalization
   for spatial prediction.}},

Journal = {{SPATIAL STATISTICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{37}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In multivariate spatio-temporal analysis, we are faced with the
   formidable challenge of specifying a valid spatio-temporal
   cross-covariance function, either directly or through the construction
   of processes. This task is difficult as these functions should yield
   positive definite covariance matrices. In recent years, we have seen a
   flourishing of methods and theories on constructing spatio-temporal
   cross-covariance functions satisfying the positive definiteness
   requirement. A subset of those techniques produced spatio-temporal
   cross-covariance functions possessing the additional feature of
   nonstationarity. Here we provide a review of the state-of-the-art
   methods and technical progress regarding model construction. In
   addition, we introduce a rich class of multivariate spatio-temporal
   asymmetric nonstationary models stemming from the Lagrangian framework.
   We demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed models on a bivariate
   reanalysis climate model output dataset previously analyzed using purely
   spatial models. Furthermore, we carry out a cross-validation study to
   examine the advantages of using spatio-temporal models over purely
   spatial models. Finally, we outline future research directions and open
   problems. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The paper provides a way to model axially symmetric random fields
   defined over the two-dimensional unit sphere embedded in the
   three-dimensional Euclidean space. Specifically, our strategy is to
   integrate an isotropic random field on the sphere over longitudinal arcs
   with a given central angle. The resulting random field is shown to be
   axially symmetric and to have the arc central angle as a tuning
   parameter that allows for isotropy as well as for longitudinal
   independence as limit cases. We then consider multivariate
   longitudinally integrated random fields, having the same properties of
   axial symmetry and a tuning parameter (arc central angle) proper to each
   random field component. This construction allows for a unified framework
   for vector-valued random fields that can be geodesically isotropic,
   axially symmetric, or longitudinally independent. Additionally, all the
   components of the vector random field are allowed to be
   cross-correlated. We finally show how to simulate the proposed axially
   symmetric scalar and vector random fields through a computationally
   efficient algorithm that exactly reproduces the desired covariance
   structure and provides approximately Gaussian finite-dimensional

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate the spatial variability of
   soybean yield, carbon stock, and soil physical attributes using
   multivariate and geostatistical techniques. The attributes were
   determined in Oxisols samples with clayey and cohesive textures
   collected from the municipality of Mata Roma, Maranhao state, Brazil. In
   the study area, 70 sampling points were demarcated, and soybean yield
   and soil attributes were evaluated at soil depths of 0-0.20 and
   0.20-0.40 m. Data were analysed using multivariate analyses (principal
   component analysis, PCA) and geostatistical tools. The mean soybean
   yield was 3,370 kg ha(-1). The semivariogram of productivity, organic
   carbon (OC), and carbon stock (Cst) at the 0-0.20 m layer were adjusted
   to the spherical model. The PCA explained 73.21\% of the variance and
   covariance structure between productivity and soil attributes at the
   0-0.20 m layer {[}(PCA 1 (26.89\%), PCA 2 (24.10\%), and PCA 3
   (22.22\%)] and 68.64\% at the 0.20-0.40 m layer {[}PCA 1 (31.95\%), PCA
   2 (22.83\%), and PCA 3 (13.85\%)]. The spatial variability maps of the
   PCA eigenvalue scores showed that it is possible to determine management
   zones using PCA 1 in the two studied depths; however, with different
   management strategies for each of the layers in this study.}},

Title = {{Stepwise covariance matrix decomposition for efficient simulation of

Abstract = {{The spatial variability of geomaterials affects the failure mechanism
   and reliability of geotechnical structures significantly, and can be
   modeled rigorously as a three-dimensional (3-D) random field. However,
   the simulation of multivariate, large-scale and high-resolution 3-D
   random fields is a challenging task due to extraordinary demands in
   computational resources. This paper proposes a stepwise covariance
   matrix decomposition method (CMD) with the aid of separable correlation
   functions, in which the 3-D random field is generated sequentially along
   each single dimension with small one-dimensional correlation matrices.
   The method not only inherits the simplicity of the widely-used general
   CMD, but also significantly reduces the computational time and required
   memory space. It only takes a few seconds to construct large-scale and
   high-resolution 3-D random fields, with the requirement on memory space
   reduced by more than ten orders of magnitude. The maximum random field
   resolution is significantly improved from approximately 21 x 21 x 41
   using the general CMD to over 501 x 501 x 1001 using the stepwise CMD,
   which suffices in most engineering applications. The stepwise CMD
   facilitates 3-D spatial variability modeling in probabilistic site
   characterization and routine geotechnical reliability analysis. (C) 2018

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{17-27}},

Abstract = {{The uncertainty simulation related to a spatially varying physical
   property requires the theory of the random field discretization. A
   random field in definition consists of an infinite number of random
   variables that are attached to all points within the simulation domain.
   The utility of the Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) expansion allows representing a
   second-order random field as the summation of a few deterministic
   functions and standard random variables. However, the K-L expansion
   depends on exact eigensolutions of the Fredholm integral equation of the
   second kind. Along with an emerging trend of the random field simulation
   combined with a complex geometry, analytical expansion results are
   increasingly inapplicable in engineering reality. To this end, the paper
   presents a high-order polynomial based Ritz-Galerkin approach. To
   implement, the Legendre, the Chebyshev, and the Gegenbauer orthogonal
   polynomials are used to realize the Ritz-Galerkin approximation.
   Together with the Gaussian-quadrature based interpolation scheme in
   approximating covariance models, numerical results for eigensolutions
   have demonstrated the spectral accuracy of the proposed approach.
   Results for the non-stationary, non-Gaussian and multivariate random
   field simulations have validated the high-order polynomial based
   Ritz-Galerkin approach has engineering applications.}},

Abstract = {{A thin-tailed vector random field, referred to as a K-differenced vector
   random field, is introduced. Its finite-dimensional densities are the
   differences of two Besse! functions of second order, whenever they
   exist, and its finite-dimensional characteristic functions have simple
   closed forms as the differences of two power functions or logarithm
   functions. Its finite-dimensional distributions have thin tails, even
   thinner than those of a Gaussian one, and it reduces to a Linnik or
   Laplace vector random field in a limiting case. As one of its most
   valuable properties, a K-differencexl vector random field is
   characterized by its mean and covariance matrix functions just like a
   Gaussian one. Some covariance matrix structures are constructed in this
   paper for not only the K-differenced vector random field, but also for
   other second-order elliptically contoured vector random fields.
   Properties of the multivariate K-differenced distribution are also

Title = {{A copula model for non-Gaussian multivariate spatial data}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{169}},
Pages = {{264-277}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We propose a new copula model for replicated multivariate spatial data.
   Unlike classical models that assume multivariate normality of the data,
   the proposed copula is based on the assumption that some factors exist
   that affect the joint spatial dependence of all measurements of each
   variable as well as the joint dependence among these variables. The
   model is parameterized in terms of a cross-covariance function that may
   be chosen from the many models proposed in the literature. In addition,
   there are additive factors in the model that allow tail dependence and
   reflection asymmetry of each variable measured at different locations,
   and of different variables to be modeled. The proposed approach can
   therefore be seen as an extension of the linear model of
   coregionalization widely used for modeling multivariate spatial data.
   The likelihood of the model can be obtained in a simple form and,
   therefore, the likelihood estimation is quite fast. The model is not
   restricted to the set of data locations, and using the estimated copula,
   spatial data can be interpolated at locations where values of variables
   are unknown. We apply the proposed model to temperature and pressure
   data, and we compare its performance with that of a popular model from
   multivariate geostatistics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Some recent work on conditional formulation of multivariate Gaussian
   Markov random fields is presented. The focus is on model constructions
   by compatible conditionals and coregionalization. Special attention is
   given to multivariate generalizations of univariate models. Beginning
   with univariate model constructions, a survey of key approaches to
   formulating multivariate extensions is presented. Two challenges in the
   formulation and implementation of multivariate models are highlighted:
   (1) entanglement of spatial and non-spatial components, and (2)
   enforcement for positivity condition. Managing the two challenges by
   decomposition, separation, and constrained parameterization is
   discussed. Also highlighted is the challenge of flexible modeling of
   (conditional) cross-spatial dependencies and, in particular, asymmetric
   cross-spatial dependencies. Interpretation of asymmetric cross-spatial
   dependencies is also discussed. A coregionalization framework which
   connects and unifies the various lines of model development is
   presented. The framework enables a systematic development of a broad
   range of models via linear and spatially varying coregionalization,
   respectively, with extensions to locally adaptive models. Formulation of
   multivariate models over variable-specific lattices is discussed.
   Selected models are illustrated with examples of Bayesian multivariate
   and spatiotemporal disease mapping. Potential applications of
   coregionalization models in imaging analysis, covariance modeling,
   dimension reduction, and latent variable analysis are briefly mentioned.}},

Abstract = {{Gaussian likelihood inference has been studied and used extensively in
   both statistical theory and applications due to its simplicity. However,
   in practice, the assumption of Gaussianity is rarely met in the analysis
   of spatial data. In this paper, we study the effect of non-Gaussianity
   on Gaussian likelihood inference for the parameters of the Matern
   covariance model. By using Monte Carlo simulations, we generate spatial
   data from a Tukey g-and-h random field, a flexible trans-Gaussian random
   field, with the Matern covariance function, where g controls skewness
   and h controls tail heaviness. We use maximum likelihood based on the
   multivariate Gaussian distribution to estimate the parameters of the
   Matern covariance function. We illustrate the effects of non-Gaussianity
   of the data on the estimated covariance function by means of functional
   boxplots. Thanks to our tailored simulation design, a comparison of the
   maximum likelihood estimator under both the increasing and fixed domain
   asymptotics for spatial data is performed. We find that the maximum
   likelihood estimator based on Gaussian likelihood is overall satisfying
   and preferable than the non-distribution-based weighted least squares
   estimator for data from the Tukey g-and-h random field. We also present
   the result for Gaussian kriging based on Matern covariance estimates
   with data from the Tukey g-and-h random field and observe an overall
   satisfactory performance.}},

Abstract = {{This work focuses on the characterization of the central tendency of a
   sample of compositional data. It provides new results about theoretical
   properties of means and covariance functions for compositional data,
   with an axiomatic perspective. Original results that shed new light on
   geostatistical modeling of compositional data are presented. As a first
   result, it is shown that the weighted arithmetic mean is the only
   central tendency characteristic satisfying a small set of axioms, namely
   continuity, reflexivity, and marginal stability. Moreover, this set of
   axioms also implies that the weights must be identical for all parts of
   the composition. This result has deep consequences for spatial
   multivariate covariance modeling of compositional data. In a
   geostatistical setting, it is shown as a second result that the
   proportional model of covariance functions (i.e., the product of a
   covariance matrix and a single correlation function) is the only model
   that provides identical kriging weights for all components of the
   compositional data. As a consequence of these two results, the
   proportional model of covariance function is the only covariance model
   compatible with reflexivity and marginal stability.}},

Abstract = {{Matrix-valued covariance functions are crucial to geostatistical
   modelling of multivariate spatial data. The classical assumption of
   symmetry of a multivariate covariance function is overly restrictive and
   has been considered as unrealistic for most of the real data
   applications. Despite of that, the literature on asymmetric covariance
   functions has been very sparse. In particular, there is some work
   related to asymmetric covariances on Euclidean spaces, depending on the
   Euclidean distance. However, for data collected over large portions of
   planet Earth, the most natural spatial domain is a sphere, with the
   corresponding geodesic distance being the natural metric. In this work,
   we propose a strategy based on spatial rotations to generate asymmetric
   covariances for multivariate random fields on the d-dimensional unit
   sphere. We illustrate through simulations as well as real data analysis
   that our proposal allows to achieve improvements in the predictive
   performance in comparison to the symmetric counterpart.}},

   a second-order Levy process on the real line, a d-variate random vector

   the multivariate case and results in a vector random field in with
   isotropic direct covariance functions and with any specified infinitely

   Laplace approximation combined with stochastic partial differential
   equations were used for inference and prediction, as a fast and precise
   alternative to the computationally intensive Markov chain Monte Carlo
   methods. A large set of models is considered in this paper: models
   assuming independent, shared or correlated spatial and temporal
   processes (with nine possible combinations), and models with
   independent, shared and linear models of coregionalization
   spatiotemporal processes. Different processes are applied to Culicoides
   data and compared. Bayesian spatial prediction results show that the
   central and Northeastern parts of Belgium had the highest prevalence of
   Culicoides in summer months and the lowest prevalence in winter months.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers a multivariate spatial random field, with each
   component having univariate marginal distributions of the skewGaussian
   type. We assume that the field is defined spatially on the unit sphere
   embedded in R-3, allowing for modeling data available over large
   portions of planet Earth. This model admits explicit expressions for the
   marginal and cross covariances. However, the n-dimensional distributions
   of the field are difficult to evaluate, because it requires the sum of
   2n terms involving the cumulative and probability density functions of a
   n-dimensional Gaussian distribution. Since in this case inference based
   on the full likelihood is computationally unfeasible, we propose a
   composite likelihood approach based on pairs of spatial observations.
   This last being possible thanks to the fact that we have a closed form
   expression for the bivariate distribution. We illustrate the
   effectiveness of the method through simulation experiments and the
   analysis of a real data set of minimum and maximum surface air
   temperatures. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Multivariate spatial field data are increasingly common and their
   modeling typically relies on building cross-covariance functions to
   describe cross-process relationships. An alternative viewpoint is to
   model the matrix of spectral measures. We develop the notions of
   coherence, phase, and gain for multidimensional stationary processes.
   Coherence, as a function of frequency, is a measure of linear
   relationship between two spatial processes at that frequency. We use the
   coherence function to illustrate fundamental limitations on a number of
   previously proposed constructions for multivariate processes, suggesting
   these options are not viable for data modeling. We also give natural
   interpretations to cross-covariance parameters of the Matern class,
   where the cross-smoothness controls the decay of coherence at infinitely
   high frequencies, and the cross-range parameter controls the frequency
   of greatest coherence. These interpretations provide warnings for
   particular parameter combinations that imply potentially non-physical
   relationships between variables. Estimation follows from smoothed
   multivariate periodogram matrices. We illustrate the estimation and
   interpretation of these functions on two datasets, forecast and
   reanalysis sea level pressure and geopotential heights over the
   equatorial region.}},

Title = {{A geostatistical approach to measure the consistency between geological
   logs and quantitative covariates}},
Journal = {{ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS}},

Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{160-169}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Core logging is the geological study, recording and classification of
   petrophysical attributes of drill hole samples, such as lithology,
   alteration or mineralogical assemblage. The geological logging is
   qualitative and subject to errors because of its visual nature and other
   factors inherent to logging, such as low drill hole recoveries,
   difficulties in estimating the volumetric contents of minerals, or
   different logging criteria among geologists. To date, different tools
   for quality control and validation of geological logging have been
   elaborated, based on geological knowledge, statistics, geostatistics,
   image analysis, neural network and data mining. This paper presents an
   alternative approach based on geostatistical modeling for identifying
   and reclassifying potentially mislogged samples when quantitative
   covariates from geochemical analyses or metallurgical tests are
   available. The principle of this approach is to: (i) define geological
   domains for each quantitative variable by an adequate grouping of the
   log classes; (ii) transform the quantitative variables into normal
   scores, accounting for the previously defined domains, (iii) model the
   spatial correlation structure of the normal scores, (iv) perform
   leave-one-out cross validation and obtain predictions of the normal
   variables and the associated variance-covariance matrices of prediction
   errors; (v) calculate a measure of consistency for each sample and each
   possible logged class under a multivariate normal assumption; and (vi)
   compare these measures of consistency with the actual logged classes to
   detect suspicious logs. The methodology is demonstrated in a case study
   from an iron ore deposit, with data of rock type logged by geologists
   and seven quantitative variables (grades of elements of interest, loss
   on ignition and granulometry). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Multivariate geostatistics is based on modelling all covariances between
   all possible combinations of two or more variables at any sets of
   locations in a continuously indexed domain. Multivariate spatial
   covariance models need to be built with care, since any covariance
   matrix that is derived from such a model must be nonnegative-definite.
   In this article, we develop a conditional approach for spatial-model
   construction whose validity conditions are easy to check. We start with
   bivariate spatial covariance models and go on to demonstrate the
   approach's connection to multivariate models defined by networks of
   spatial variables. In some circumstances, such as modelling respiratory
   illness conditional on air pollution, the direction of conditional
   dependence is clear. When it is not, the two directional models can be
   compared. More generally, the graph structure of the network reduces the
   number of possible models to compare. Model selection then amounts to
   finding possible causative links in the network. We demonstrate our
   conditional approach on surface temperature and pressure data, where the
   role of the two variables is seen to be asymmetric.}},

Abstract = {{Multivariate space-time data are increasingly available in various
   scientific disciplines. When analyzing these data, one of the key issues
   is to describe the multivariate space-time dependences. Under the
   Gaussian framework, one needs to propose relevant models for
   multivariate space-time covariance functions, i.e. matrix-valued
   mappings with the additional requirement of non-negative definiteness.
   We propose a flexible parametric class of cross-covariance functions for
   multivariate space-time Gaussian random fields. Space-time components
   belong to the (univariate) Gneiting class of space-time covariance
   functions, with Matern or Cauchy covariance functions in the spatial
   margins. The smoothness and scale parameters can be different for each
   variable. We provide sufficient conditions for positive definiteness. A
   simulation study shows that the parameters of this model can be
   efficiently estimated using weighted pairwise likelihood, which belongs
   to the class of composite likelihood methods. We then illustrate the
   model on a French dataset of weather variables. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Conventional geostatistical simulation methods are implemented in a way
   that is inherently gridded and sequence dependent. A variant of spectral
   simulation method is revisited from a linear model of regionalization
   standpoint to simulate realizations of coregionalized variables that are
   expressed as a function of the coordinates of the simulation locations,
   data values, and imposed spatial structure. The resulting grid-free
   simulation (GFS) methodology expresses a realization at any set of
   regularly or irregularly distributed nodes. GFS consists of two main
   steps: unconditional grid-free simulation and dual cokriging-based
   conditioning. The unconditional multivariate simulation is represented
   by a linear model of coregionalization, where weights are derived from
   the covariance function of the modeled system, and random factors are
   computed as a sum of equally weighted line processes within a turning
   bands paradigm. These stochastic line processes are expressed as a
   linear model of regionalization, weights are from the Fourier series
   decomposition of line covariance functions, and random factors have a
   cosine function form requiring coordinates of simulation locations and
   the random phases. The resulting conditionally simulated values are
   uniquely tied to simulation locations by an analytical form. Newly
   assimilated data change current realizations only locally within the
   correlation range. The GFS parameters are carefully chosen from a series
   of examples, and the associated theory is illustrated with a
   three-dimensional case study.}},

Abstract = {{In the recent years, there has been a growing interest in proposing
   covariance models for multivariate Gaussian random fields. Some of these
   covariance models are very flexible and can capture both the marginal
   and the cross-spatial dependence of the components of the associated
   multivariate Gaussian random field. However, effective estimation
   methods for these models are somehow unexplored. Maximum likelihood is
   certainly a useful tool, but it is impractical in all the circumstances
   where the number of observations is very large. In this work, we
   consider two possible approaches based on composite likelihood for
   multivariate covariance model estimation. We illustrate, through
   simulation experiments, that our methods offer a good balance between
   statistical efficiency and computational complexity. Asymptotic
   properties of the proposed estimators are assessed under increasing
   domain asymptotics. Finally, we apply the method for the analysis of a
   bivariate dataset on chlorophyll concentration and sea surface
   temperature in the Chilean coast.}},

Abstract = {{This paper concerns with multivariate conditional autoregressive models
   defined by linear combination of independent or correlated underlying
   spatial processes. Known as linear models of coregionalization, the
   method offers a systematic and unified approach for formulating
   multivariate extensions to a broad range of univariate conditional
   autoregressive models. The resulting multivariate spatial models
   represent classes of coregionalized multivariate conditional
   autoregressive models that enable flexible modelling of multivariate
   spatial interactions, yielding coregionalization models with symmetric
   or asymmetric cross-covariances of different spatial variation and
   smoothness. In the context of multivariate disease mapping, for example,
   they facilitate borrowing strength both over space and cross variables,
   allowing for more flexible multivariate spatial smoothing. Specifically,
   we present a broadened coregionalization framework to include
   order-dependent, order-free, and order-robust multivariate models; a new
   class of order-free coregionalized multivariate conditional
   autoregressives is introduced. We tackle computational challenges and
   present solutions that are integral for Bayesian analysis of these
   models. We also discuss two ways of computing deviance information
   criterion for comparison among competing hierarchical models with or
   without unidentifiable prior parameters. The models and related
   methodology are developed in the broad context of modelling multivariate
   data on spatial lattice and illustrated in the context of multivariate
   disease mapping. The coregionalization framework and related methods
   also present a general approach for building spatially structured
   cross-covariance functions for multivariate geostatistics.}},

Abstract = {{A novel grid-free geostatistical simulation method (GFS) allows
   representing coregionalized variables as an analytical function of the
   coordinates of the simulation locations. Simulation on unstructured
   grids, regridding and refinement of available realizations of natural
   phenomena including, but not limited to, environmental systems are
   possible with GFS in a consistent manner. The unconditional realizations
   are generated by utilizing the linear model of coregionalization and
   Fourier series-based decomposition of the covariance function. The
   conditioning to data is performed by kriging. The data can be measured
   at scattered point-scale locations or sampled at a block scale.
   Secondary data are usually used in conjunction with primary data for the
   improved modeling. Satellite imaging is an example of exhaustively
   sampled secondary data. Improvements and recommendations are made to the
   implementation of GFS to properly assimilate secondary exhaustive data
   sets in a grid-free manner. Intrinsic cokriging (ICK) is utilized to
   reduce computational time and preserve the overall quality of the
   simulation. To further reduce the computational cost of ICK, a block
   matrix inversion is implemented in the calculation of the kriging
   weights. A projection approach to ICK is proposed to avoid artifacts in
   the realizations around the edges of the exhaustive data region when the
   data do not cover the entire modeling domain. The point-scale block
   value representation of the block-scale data is developed as an
   alternative to block cokriging to integrate block-scale data into
   realizations within the GFS framework. Several case studies support the
   proposed enhancements.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we propose stationary covariance functions for
   processes that evolve temporally over a sphere, as well as
   cross-covariance functions for multivariate random fields defined over a
   sphere. For such processes, the great circle distance is the natural
   metric that should be used to describe spatial dependence. Given the
   mathematical difficulties for the construction of covariance functions
   for processes defined over spheres cross time, approximations of the
   state of nature have been proposed in the literature by using the
   Euclidean (based on map projections) and the chordal distances. We
   present several methods of construction based on the great circle
   distance and provide closed-form expressions for both spatio-temporal
   and multivariate cases. A simulation study assesses the discrepancy
   between the great circle distance, chordal distance, and Euclidean
   distance based on a map projection both in terms of estimation and
   prediction in a space-time and a bivariate spatial setting, where the
   space is in this case the Earth. We revisit the analysis-of Total Ozone
   Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data and investigate differences in terms of
   estimation and prediction between the aforementioned distance-based
   approaches. Both simulation and real data highlight sensible differences
   in terms of estimation of the spatial scale parameter. As far as
   prediction is concerned, the differences can be appreciated only when
   the interpoint distances are large, as demonstrated by an illustrative
   example. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.}},

Abstract = {{Wetackle the modeling of threshold exceedances in asymptotically
   independent stochastic processes by constructions based on Laplace
   random fields. Defined as mixtures of Gaussian random fields with an
   exponential variable embedded for the variance, these processes possess
   useful asymptotic properties while remaining statistically convenient.
   Univariate Laplace distribution tails are part of the limiting
   generalized Pareto distributions for threshold exceedances. After
   normalizing marginal distributions in data, a standard Laplace field can
   be used to capture spatial dependence among extremes. Asymptotic
   properties of Laplace fields are explored and compared to the classical
   framework of asymptotic dependence. Multivariate joint tail decay rates
   are slower than for Gaussian fields with the same covariance structure;
   hence they provide more conservative estimates of very extreme joint
   risks while maintaining asymptotic independence. Statistical inference
   is illustrated on extreme wind gusts in the Netherlands where a
   comparison to the Gaussian dependence model shows a better
   goodness-of-fit. In this application we fit the well-adapted Weibull
   distribution, closely related to the Laplace distribution, as univariate
   tail model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Multivariate and geostatistical analyses to evaluate lowland soil
   levelling effects on physico-chemical properties}},
Journal = {{SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{156}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{63-73}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Levelling is used in rice fields to correct land irregularities for
   management practice improvement. Effects of levelling have been
   evaluated using univariate tools from classical statistics and
   geostatistics, which disregard possible effects on interrelations among
   soil properties. This study aimed to: (i) evaluate the effect of
   levelling on soil physico-chemical properties using classical statistics
   and geostatistical tools, (ii) group soil properties in homogeneous sets
   using multivariate cluster analysis, (iii) reduce the dimensionality of
   sets by principal component analysis, and (iv) characterize and map
   spatial distributions of principal components to compare them with
   individual maps to elaborate maps of homogeneous management zones. On a
   1.0 ha field in Southern Brazil a grid of 10 x 10 m points was used to
   sample the 0-0.20 m soil layer, before and after levelling. All data
   sets were submitted to descriptive statistics and the Kolmogorov Smirnov
   (K-S) test, as well as to geostatistical analysis. Maps were constructed
   using ordinary kriging or the inverse square distance interpolation.
   Groups were formed by cluster analysis. To reduce their dimensionality
   principal component analysis and geostatistics were used to evaluate
   spatial dependencies of the main principal components. Maps of the main
   principal components and of each soil property were visually compared to
   verify if they had similar patterns of spatial variability. Levelling
   caused an increase of the spatial range for the majority of the
   properties as well as an improvement of the goodness of fit of the
   semivariogram models. Variability structures of the majority of the
   properties were best modeled by Gaussian and spherical models. Levelling
   also caused changes in the variance and covariance structures of all
   properties as detected by cluster multivariate analysis. Soil bulk
   density and organic matter represented the sets that were most affected
   by land levelling, so that their maps are considered useful and
   accessible tools for farmers in future operations of land recuperation.

Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In recent literature there has been a growing interest in the
   construction of covariance models for multivariate Gaussian random
   fields. However, effective estimation methods for these models are
   somehow unexplored. The maximum likelihood method has attractive
   features, but when we deal with large data sets this solution becomes
   impractical, so computationally efficient solutions have to be devised.
   In this paper we explore the use of the covariance tapering method for
   the estimation of multivariate covariance models. In particular, through
   a simulation study, we compare the use of simple separable tapers with
   more flexible multivariate tapers recently proposed in the literature
   and we discuss the asymptotic properties of the method under increasing
   domain asymptotics.}},

Abstract = {{Multivariate log-Gaussian Cox processes are flexible models for
   multivariate point patterns. However, they have so far been applied in
   bivariate cases only. We move beyond the bivariate case to model
   multispecies point patterns of tree locations. In particular we address
   the problems of identifying parsimonious models and of extracting
   biologically relevant information from the models fitted. The latent
   multivariate Gaussian field is decomposed into components given in terms
   of random fields common to all species and components which are species
   specific. This allows a decomposition of variance that can be used to
   quantify to what extent the spatial variation of a species is governed
   by common or species-specific factors. Cross-validation is used to
   select the number of common latent fields to obtain a suitable trade-off
   between parsimony and fit of the data. The selected number of common
   latent fields provides an index of complexity of the multivariate
   covariance structure. Hierarchical clustering is used to identify groups
   of species with similar patterns of dependence on the common latent
   fields.}},

Abstract = {{This work pertains to the simulation of an intrinsic random field of
   order with a given generalized covariance function and multivariate
   Gaussian generalized increments. An iterative algorithm based on the
   Gibbs sampler is proposed to simulate such a random field at a finite
   set of locations, resulting in a sequence of random vectors that
   converges in distribution to a random vector with the desired
   distribution. The algorithm is tested on synthetic case studies to
   experimentally assess its rate of convergence, showing that few
   iterations are sufficient for convergence to take place. The sequence of
   random vectors also proves to be strongly mixing, allowing the
   generation of as many independent realizations as desired with a single
   run of the algorithm. Another interesting property of this algorithm is
   its versatility, insofar as it can be adapted to construct realizations
   conditioned to pre-existing data and can be used for any number and
   configuration of the target locations and any generalized covariance
   model.}},

Abstract = {{The paper combines simple general methodologies to obtain new classes of
   matrix-valued covariance functions that have two important properties:
   (i) the domains of the compact support of the several components of the
   matrix-valued functions can vary between components; and (ii) the
   overall differentiability at the origin can also vary. These models
   exploit a class of functions called here the Wendland-Gneiting class;
   their use is illustrated via both a simulation study and an application
   to a North American bivariate dataset of precipitation and temperature.
   Because for this dataset, as for others, the empirical covariances
   exhibit a hole effect, the turning bands operator is extended to
   matrix-valued covariance functions so as to obtain matrix-valued
   covariance models with negative covariances.}},

Abstract = {{Continuously indexed datasets with multiple variables have become
   ubiquitous in the geophysical, ecological, environmental and climate
   sciences, and pose substantial analysis challenges to scientists and
   statisticians. For many years, scientists developed models that aimed at
   capturing the spatial behavior for an individual process; only within
   the last few decades has it become commonplace to model multiple
   processes jointly. The key difficulty is in specifying the
   cross-covariance function, that is, the function responsible for the
   relationship between distinct variables. Indeed, these cross-covariance
   functions must be chosen to be consistent with marginal covariance
   functions in such a way that the second-order structure always yields a
   nonnegative definite covariance matrix. We review the main approaches to
   building cross-covariance models, including the linear model of
   coregionalization, convolution methods, the multivariate Matern and
   nonstationary and space time extensions of these among others. We
   additionally cover specialized constructions, including those designed
   for asymmetry, compact support and spherical domains, with a review of
   physics-constrained models. We illustrate select models on a bivariate
   regional climate model output example for temperature and pressure,
   along with a bivariate minimum and maximum temperature observational
   dataset; we compare models by likelihood value as well as via
   cross-validation co-kriging studies. The article closes with a
   discussion of unsolved problems.}},

Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{369-378}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a methodology to address the classification of
   images that have been acquired from remote sensors. One common problem
   in classification is the high dimensionality of multivariate
   characteristics. The methodology we propose consists of reducing the
   dimensionality of the spectral bands associated with a multi-spectral
   satellite image. Such dimensionality reduction is accomplished by the
   use of the divergence of a modified Mahalanobis distance. Instead of
   using the covariance matrix of a multivariate spatial process, the
   codispersion matrix is considered which have some desirable asymptotic
   properties under very precise conditions. The consistency and asymptotic
   normality hold for a general class of processes that are a natural
   extension of the one-dimensional spatial processes for which the
   asymptotic properties were first established. The results allow the
   selection of a set of spectral bands to produce the highest value of
   divergence. Then, a supervised maximum likelihood method using the
   selected spectral bands is employed for landscape classification. An
   application with a real LANDSAT image is introduced to explore and
   visualize how our method works in practice.}},

Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{The quality of inferences made from geostatistical data is affected
   significantly by the spatial locations, or design, of the sites that are
   sampled. A large body of published work exists on sampling design for
   univariate geostatistics, but not for multivariate geostatistics. This
   article considers multivariate spatial sampling design based on criteria
   targeted at classical co-kriging (prediction with known covariance
   parameters), estimation of covariance (including cross-covariance)
   parameters, and empirical co-kriging (prediction with estimated
   covariance parameters). Through a combination of analytical results and
   examples, we investigate the characteristics of optimal designs with
   respect to each criterion, addressing in particular the design's degree
   of collocation. We also consider the robustness of the optimal design to
   the strength of spatial correlation and cross-correlation; the effects
   of smoothness and/or separability of the sampled process on the optimal
   design; the relationship between optimal designs for the multivariate
   problems considered here and univariate problems considered previously;
   and the efficiency of optimal collocated designs. One key finding is
   that optimal collocated designs are highly efficient in many cases.

Abstract = {{Two methods for generating representative realizations from Gaussian and
   lognormal random field models are studied in this paper, with term
   representative implying realizations efficiently spanning the range of
   possible attribute values corresponding to the multivariate (log)normal
   probability distribution. The first method, already established in the
   geostatistical literature, is multivariate Latin hypercube sampling, a
   form of stratified random sampling aiming at marginal stratification of
   simulated values for each variable involved under the constraint of
   reproducing a known covariance matrix. The second method, scarcely known
   in the geostatistical literature, is stratified likelihood sampling, in
   which representative realizations are generated by exploring in a
   systematic way the structure of the multivariate distribution function
   itself. The two sampling methods are employed for generating
   unconditional realizations of saturated hydraulic conductivity in a
   hydrogeological context via a synthetic case study involving
   physically-based simulation of flow and transport in a heterogeneous
   porous medium; their performance is evaluated for different sample sizes
   (number of realizations) in terms of the reproduction of ensemble
   statistics of hydraulic conductivity and solute concentration computed
   from a very large ensemble set generated via simple random sampling. The
   results show that both Latin hypercube and stratified likelihood
   sampling are more efficient than simple random sampling, in that overall
   they can reproduce to a similar extent statistics of the conductivity
   and concentration fields, yet with smaller sampling variability than the
   simple random sampling.}},

   Multivariate geostatistical determined improvements of

   Minas Gerais derived from the moisture index estimated with the MODIS
   evapotranspiration (2000-2010), presented divergence of humid conditions
   when compared to the moisture index derived from the simple kriged and

Abstract = {{Matrix-valued radially symmetric covariance functions (also called
   radial basis functions in the numerical analysis literature) are crucial
   for the analysis, inference and prediction of Gaussian vector-valued
   random fields. This paper provides different methodologies for the
   construction of matrix-valued mappings that are positive definite and
   compactly supported over the sphere of a d-dimensional space, of a given
   radius. In particular, we offer a representation based on scaled
   mixtures of Askey functions; we also suggest a method of construction
   based on B-splines. Finally, we show that the very appealing convolution
   arguments are indeed effective when working in one dimension,
   prohibitive in two and feasible, but substantially useless, when working
   in three dimensions. We exhibit the statistical performance of the
   proposed models through simulation study and then discuss the
   computational gains that come from our constructions when the parameters
   are estimated via maximum likelihood. We finally apply our constructions
   to a North American Pacific Northwest temperatures dataset.}},

Abstract = {{Measured rainfall data are important to many problems in hydrologic
   analysis and watershed management. The accurate estimation of the
   spatial distribution of rainfall requires a dense network of
   instruments, which entails large installation and operational costs. It
   is thus necessary to optimize the number of rainfall stations and
   estimate point precipitation at unrecorded locations from existing
   valued data. This paper serves 2 objectives: i) to establish a spatial
   representative rainfall stations from the entire existing network in the
   study area (i. e., rainfall-data optimization); and ii) to use of
   multivariate geostatistical algorithm for incorporating relatively
   cheaper elevation, humidity, and temperature data into the spatial
   prediction of rainfall at the study site. Yom river is the upstream
   control for the main Chao Phraya river basin. The technique was
   illustrated using annual and monthly rainfall observations measured at
   326 rain gauge stations covering the entire basin and its vicinity. The
   precipitation prediction maps, generated by Thiessen polygon, inverse
   square distance, and ordinary Kriging, were used to determine the
   sensitivity of the rainfall data to the prediction results by
   constructing the covariance surface map. Optimal rain gauge network was
   designed based on the station redundancy and the homogeneity of the
   rainfall distribution. Ranking of sensitivity in terms of prediction
   error could define the priority of supplementary stations to satisfy the
   density of rainfall data in the basin. Digital elevation, humidity, and
   temperature models were incorporated into the spatial prediction of
   rainfall using multivariate geostatistical algorithms. The prediction
   performances of the geostatistical interpolation were cross validated
   with the straightforward linear regression of rainfall against
   elevation, humidity, and temperature. The results revealed that the
   multivariate geostatistical algorithm outperformed the linear
   regression, stressing the importance of accounting for spatially
   dependent rainfall observations in addition to the co-located elevation.
   The digital elevation data were highly correlated to monthly
   monsoon-induced precipitation in the study area. Humidity and
   temperature data exhibited a higher degree of correlation to the monthly
   precipitation data.}},

Abstract = {{A formal test for weak stationarity of spatial and spatio-temporal
   random fields is proposed. We consider the cases where the spatial

   weak stationarity. Simulation results for spatial as well as
   spatio-temporal cases on the two types of spatial domains are reported.

Abstract = {{In a paper that appeared in 2010, C. Tone proved a multivariate central
   limit theorem for some strictly stationary random fields of random
   vectors satisfying certain mixing conditions. The ``normalization{''} of
   a given ``partial sum{''} (or ``block sum{''}) involved matrix
   multiplication by a ``standard -1/2 power{''} of its covariance matrix
   (a symmetric, positive definite matrix), and the limiting multivariate
   normal distribution had the identity matrix as its covariance matrix.
   The mixing assumptions in Tone's result implicitly imposed an upper
   bound on the ratios of the largest to the smallest eigenvalues in the
   covariance matrices of the partial sums. The purpose of this note is to
   show that in Tone's result, for the entire collection of the covariance
   matrices of the partial sums, there is essentially no other restriction
   on the relative magnitudes of the eigenvalues or on the (orthogonal)
   directions of the corresponding eigenvectors. For simplicity, the
   example given in this note will involve just random sequences, not the
   broader context of random fields.}},

Abstract = {{To speed up multivariate geostatistical simulation it is common to
   transform the set of attributes into spatially uncorrelated factors that
   can be simulated independently. Spatial decorrelation methods are
   usually based on the diagonalisation of the variance/covariance and
   semivariogram matrices of the set of attributes for a chosen family of
   lag spacings. These matrices are symmetric and there are several
   efficient methods for the approximate joint diagonalisation of a family
   of symmetric matrices. One of these is the uniformly weighted exhaustive
   diagonalisation with Gauss iterations (U-WEDGE) method. In contrast to
   the method of minimum/maximum autocorrelation factors (MAF), where a two
   structure linear model of coregionalisation is assumed, U-WEDGE can be
   applied directly to the set of experimental semivariogram matrices
   without having to place restrictions on the number of structures in the
   linear model of coregionalisation, thus removing one of the restrictions
   placed on the subsequent modelling of the spatial structure of the
   factors. We use an iron-ore data set to illustrate the method and
   present a comparison between the simulated attributes obtained from
   U-WEDGE and MAF with the full co-simulation of the attributes.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a valid parametric family of cross-covariance functions for
   multivariate spatial random fields where each component has a covariance
   function from a well-celebrated Matern class. Unlike previous attempts,
   our model indeed allows for various smoothnesses and rates of

   conditions on the parameter space that result in valid models with
   varying degrees of complexity. We discuss practical implementations,
   including reparameterizations to reflect the conditions on the parameter
   space and an iterative algorithm to increase the computational
   efficiency. We perform various Monte Carlo simulation experiments to
   explore the performances of our approach in terms of estimation and
   cokriging. The application of the proposed multivariate Matern model is
   illustrated on two meteorological datasets: temperature/pressure over
   the Pacific Northwest (bivariate) and wind/temperature/pressure in
   Oklahoma (trivariate). In the latter case, our flexible trivariate
   Matern model is valid and yields better predictive scores compared with
   a parsimonious model with common scale parameters.}},

Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{17-30}},

Abstract = {{Many farmers want to take advantage of modern technology to control
   fertilizer applications in large fields more precisely in smaller zones.
   We have investigated zonation on past yields by three forms of k-means
   clustering with geostatistical smoothing and compared the outcomes with
   yield response to added nitrogen. We had data on wheat yield for three
   years on 2187 10 x 10 m squares in a 29-ha field in the English
   midlands. Two of the methods grouped the squares by a `hard' means
   technique, the first used their similarities which had been modified
   with their spatial covariance function and the second used their
   dissimilarities which had been modified with their variogram. The third
   method computed their memberships to fuzzy classes and smoothed the
   memberships with the variogram for final classification. The resulting
   spatially smoothed classifications were evaluated by the extent to which
   they responded differentially to applied nitrogen in a fourth year.
   The best compromise between spatial coherence and minimum variance
   seemed to be the smoothed fuzzy classification; it created reasonably
   compact zones that a well-equipped farmer might be able to manage.
   However, the nitrogen response functions were parallel, and it is
   unlikely that a farmer would benefit financially by fertilizing the
   zones separately. The soil map of the field also distinguished coherent
   compact zones, and these differed in the forms of the responses of their
   crops to fertilizer nitrogen. For this field, it might be more
   profitable to manage the nitrogen application according to soil type.

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{It is common in geostatistics to use the variogram to describe the
   spatial dependence structure and to use kriging as the spatial
   prediction methodology. Both methods are sensitive to outlying
   observations and are strongly influenced by the marginal distribution of
   the underlying random field. Hence, they lead to unreliable results when
   applied to extreme value or multimodal data. As an alternative to
   traditional spatial modeling and interpolation we consider the use of
   copula functions. This paper extends existing copula-based
   geostatistical models. We show how location dependent covariates e. g. a
   spatial trend can be accounted for in spatial copula models.
   Furthermore, we introduce geostatistical copula-based models that are
   able to deal with random fields having discrete marginal distributions.
   We propose three different copula-based spatial interpolation methods.
   By exploiting the relationship between bivariate copulas and indicator
   covariances, we present indicator kriging and disjunctive kriging. As a
   second method we present simple kriging of the rank-transformed data.
   The third method is a plug-in prediction and generalizes the frequently
   applied trans-Gaussian kriging. Finally, we report on the results
   obtained for the so-called Helicopter data set which contains extreme
   radioactivity measurements.}},

   spatio-temporal cross-covariance functions that can be nonseparable,

   different smoothness parameters, in each component. We discuss
   estimation of these models and perform a small simulation study to

Abstract = {{This paper presents random field models with Gaussian or gamma
   univariate distributions and isofactorial bivariate distributions,
   constructed by composing two independent random fields: a directing
   function with stationary Gaussian increments and a stationary coding
   process with bivariate Gaussian or gamma distributions. Two variations
   are proposed, by considering a multivariate directing function and a
   coding process with a separable covariance, or by including drift
   components in the directing function. Iterative algorithms based on the
   Gibbs sampler allow one to condition the realizations of the
   substitution random fields to a set of data, while the inference of the
   model parameters relies on simple tools such as indicator variograms and
   variograms of different orders. A case study in polluted soil management
   is presented, for which a gamma model is used to quantify the risk that
   pollutant concentrations over remediation units exceed a given toxicity
   level. Unlike the multivariate Gaussian model, the proposed gamma model
   accounts for an asymmetry in the spatial correlation of the indicator
   functions around the median and for a spatial clustering of high
   pollutant concentrations.}},

Title = {{Simulation of simply cross correlated random fields by series expansion
   methods}},
Journal = {{STRUCTURAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{337-363}},
Abstract = {{A practical framework for generating cross correlated random fields with
   a specified marginal distribution function, an autocorrelation function
   and cross correlation coefficients is presented in the paper. The
   approach relies on well-known series expansion methods for simulation of
   a Gaussian random field. The proposed method requires all cross
   correlated fields over the domain to share an identical autocorrelation
   function and the cross correlation structure between each pair of
   simulated fields to be simply defined by a cross correlation
   coefficient. Such relations result in specific properties of
   eigenvectors of covariance matrices of discretized field over the
   domain. These properties are used to decompose the eigenproblem, which
   must normally be solved in computing the series expansion, into two
   smaller eigenproblems. Such a decomposition represents a significant
   reduction of computational effort.
   Non-Gaussian components of a multivariate random field are proposed to
   be simulated via memoryless transformation of underlying Gaussian random
   fields for which the Nataf model is employed to modify the correlation
   structure. In this method, the autocorrelation structure of each field
   is fulfilled exactly while the cross correlation is only approximated.
   The associated errors can be computed before performing simulations and
   it is shown that the errors happen only in the cross correlation between
   distant points and that they are negligibly small in practical
   situations.
   Some comments on available techniques for simulation of underlying
   random variables in connection with the accuracy of basic fields'
   statistics at a given sample size are made. For this purpose a simple
   error assessment procedure is presented.
   Simulated random fields can be used both for representation of spatially
   correlated properties of structure or random load in the stochastic
   finite element method (SFEM). An example of this application is related
   to size effect studies in the nonlinear fracture mechanics of concrete,
   and is used to illustrate the method. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Hybrid geostatistical prediction methods incorporate (i)
   spatially-explicit soil observations and exhaustive grids of ancillary
   environmental variables (e.g. derived from remote sensing), (ii) spatial
   autocorrelation, (iii) spatial covariation, and/or (iv) combinations of
   the above. In numerous studies of terrestrial soils it has been shown
   that hybrid geostatistical methods outperform univariate spatial and
   regression (aspatial) methods. However, hybrid methods have rarely been
   employed to predict soil properties in wetlands, In this study we used
   spectral data and derived indices from two remote sensors (Landsat ETM+
   and ASTER), with different spatial resolutions, from different seasons,
   but with similar spectral range, ancillary environmental data, as well
   as floc and soil total phosphorus (TP) observations from 111 sites. The
   specific objective of our study was to evaluate the performance of
   aspatial methods (multivariate regressions - REG), univariate spatial
   (Ordinary Kriging - OK) and hybrid/multivariate geostatistical methods
   (Regression Kriging - RK and Co-kriging - CK) in predicting the spatial
   variability and distribution of floc and soil TP in a subtropical
   wetland, WCA-2A, in the Florida Everglades. Measured floc TP ranged from
   194 to 1865 mg kg(-1) with a median of 751 mg kg-1 and standard
   deviation (SD) of 381 mg kg(-1). According to cross-validation,
   predictions for floc TP based on the root mean square prediction error
   (RMSE) were best in the following order: RKquadratic
   (134.9)>RKmultivariate (201.1)>OK (206.1)>CK (212.1)> REG(multivariate)
   (218.3)>REG(quadratic) (220.3)>REG(linear) (264.4); and based on the
   mean prediction error (ME) followed the order RKmultivariate
   (0.9)similar to RKquadratic (1.1)>CK (-6.7)>REG(multivariate)
   (18.2)>REG(linear) (25.1)>OK (-27.3)>REG(quadratic) (27.3). The
   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)-green derived from Landsat
   ETM+ showed the largest predictive power for floc TP. Measured soil TP
   ranged from 155 to 1702 mg kg(-1) with a median of 433 mg kg(-1) and
   standard deviation of 316 mg kg(-1). Predictions for soil TP based on
   RMSE were best in the following order: RKASTER (200.1)>CKASTER
   (238.2)similar to CKETM (239.0)>OK (258.0)>RKETM (279.2)>REG(ASTER)
   (281.8)>REG(ETM) (356.1); and based on ME followed the order: CKASTER
   (0-1)similar to CKETM (0.2)>RKASTER (-5.2)>RKETM (-31.5)>OK
   (-41.8)>REG(ASTER) (94.4)> REG(ETM) (133.7). The NDVI showed the largest
   predictive power for soil TP. This comparative study in a subtropical
   wetland demonstrated the benefits of incorporating remote sensing data
   into floc and soil TP prediction models. Overall, hybrid geostatistical
   methods (CK and RK) performed better than regressions and spatial
   univariate models (OK) in the prediction of floc and soil TP. Depending
   on the strength of the spatial covariance between primary and secondary
   variables (CK) and the ability of the regression model in RK to explain
   the variability of a target variable (e.g., floc or soil TP), either CK
   or RK performed best. Our findings in this wetland confirmed results
   from earlier studies on terrestrial soils indicating the superior
   performance of hybrid geostatistical methods in predicting soil
   properties. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Soil pollution data collection typically studies multivariate
   measurements at sampling locations, e.g., lead, zinc, copper or cadmium
   levels. With increased collection of such multivariate geostatistical
   spatial data, there arises the need for flexible explanatory stochastic
   models. Here, we propose a general constructive approach for building
   suitable models based upon convolution of covariance functions. We begin
   with a general theorem which asserts that, under weak conditions, cross
   convolution of covariance functions provides a valid cross covariance
   function. We also obtain a result on dependence induced by such
   convolution. Since, in general, convolution does not provide closed-form
   integration, we discuss efficient computation.
   We then suggest introducing such specification through a Gaussian
   process to model multivariate spatial random effects within a
   hierarchical model. We note that modeling spatial random effects in this
   way is parsimonious relative to say, the linear model of
   coregionalization. Through a limited simulation, we informally
   demonstrate that performance for these two specifications appears to be
   indistinguishable, encouraging the parsimonious choice. Finally, we use
   the convolved covariance model to analyze a trivariate pollution dataset

Abstract = {{The simulation of spatially correlated Gaussian random fields is
   widespread in geologic, hydrologic and environmental applications for
   characterizing the uncertainty about the unsampled values of
   regionalized attributes. In this respect, the turning bands method has
   received attention among practitioners, for it allows multidimensional
   simulations to be generated at the CPU cost of one-dimensional
   simulations.
   This work provides and documents a set of computer programs for (i)
   constructing three-dimensional realizations of stationary and intrinsic
   Gaussian random fields, (ii) conditioning these realizations to a set of
   data and (iii) back-transforming the Gaussian values to the original
   attribute units. Such programs can deal with simulations over large
   domains and handle anisotropic and nested covariance models.
   The quality of the proposed programs is examined through an example
   consisting of a non-conditional simulation of a spherical covariance
   model. The artifact banding in the simulated maps is shown to be
   negligible when thousands of lines are used. The main parameters of the
   univariate and bivariate distributions, as well as their expected
   ergodic fluctuations, also prove to be accurately reproduced. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{Groundwater quality parameters exhibit considerable spatial variability.
   Geostatistical methods including the assessment of variograms are
   usually used to characterize this variability. Copulas offer an
   interesting opportunity to describe dependence structures for
   multivariate distributions. Bivariate empirical copulas can be used as
   an alternative to variograms and covariance functions for the
   description of the spatial variability. Rank correlations of these
   copulas express the strength of the dependence independently of the
   marginal distributions and thus offer an alternative to the variograms.
   Empirical copulas for four quality parameters, chloride, sulfate, pH,
   and nitrate, obtained from a large-scale groundwater quality measurement
   network in Baden-Wurttemberg (Germany) are calculated. They indicate
   that the spatial dependence structure of the investigated parameters is
   not Gaussian. Two theoretical copula-based models are presented in this
   paper: a Gaussian and a non-Gaussian. Bootstrap-based statistical tests
   using stochastic simulation of the multivariate distributions are used
   to investigate the appropriateness of the models. According to the test
   results the Gaussian copula is rejected for most of the parameters while
   the non-Gaussian alternative is not rejected in most cases.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrologic and ecologic studies in mountainous terrain are sensitive to
   the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation. In this study a
   geostatistical model, Auto-Searched Orographic and Atmospheric Effects
   Detrended Kriging (ASOADeK), is introduced to map mountain precipitation
   using only precipitation gauge data. The ASOADeK model considers both
   precipitation spatial covariance and orographic and atmospheric effects
   in estimating precipitation distribution. The model employs gauge data
   and a multivariate linear regression approach to autosearch regional and
   local climatic settings (i.e., infer the spatial gradient in atmospheric
   moisture distribution and the effective moisture flux direction), and
   local orographic effects ( the effective terrain elevation and aspect).
   The observed gauge precipitation data are then spatially detrended by
   the autosearched regression surface. The spatially detrended gauge data
   are further interpolated by ordinary kriging to generate a residual
   precipitation surface. The precipitation map is then constructed by
   adding the regression surface to the kriged residual surface. The
   ASOADeK model was applied to map monthly precipitation for a mountainous
   area in semiarid northern New Mexico. The effective moisture flux
   directions and spatial moisture trends identified by the optimal
   multiple linear regressions, using only gauge data, agree with the
   regional climate setting. When compared to a common precipitation
   mapping product {[}Precipitation-elevation Regression on Independent
   Slopes Model ( PRISM)], the ASOADeK summer precipitation maps of the
   study area agree well with the PRISM estimates, and with higher spatial
   resolution. The ASOADeK winter maps improve upon PRISM estimates.
   ASOADeK gives better estimates than precipitation kriging and
   precipitation-elevation cokriging because it considers orographic and
   atmospheric effects more completely.}},

Volume = {{37}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The profitability of a cement plant depends largely on its capacity to
   produce homogeneous cement with chemical composition close to specified
   targets for the cement type produced. One crucial step is the mixing of
   limestone with other raw materials in proportions calculated to meet
   these targets. Major design and operation decisions depend on the
   efficiency of this homogenizing step. The adequate modeling of the
   mixing process requires simulation of representative cross-correlated
   time series of chemical compositions of the raw materials involved. The
   chemical composition signals are obtained by multivariate geostatistical
   simulation using an LU (Cholesky) decomposition of the covariance
   matrix. Modifications to the usual LU method are presented. First, the
   effect on the raw covariance matrix of the closure property of chemical
   analysis is imposed. Second, the problem of memory space limitations in
   the LU method is tackled by using overlapping sliding neighbourhoods.
   The simulation algorithm is applied to the Joppa cement plant owned by
   Lafarge North America. The simulated raw material input streams are fed
   into the quality mix control (QMC), a proprietary software that models
   and controls the mixing operation to produce an output stream with
   cement characteristics as close as possible to desired targets. Two
   signal series are studied, one autocorrelated with a moderate temporal
   range and one with no autocorrelation. The QMC produces C3S output
   signals having comparable short scale periodic variograms except that
   the variance of the uncorrelated signal is four times greater than those
   of the autocorrelated signal and the real Joppa data. The raw material
   feeder variograms have the same sill for both the white noise and the
   autocorrelated signals. However, the autocorrelated signal feeder
   variogram presents lower short term dispersion variance, a
   characteristic feature of Joppa operations. Our results show the
   importance of simulating the right temporal structure of the raw
   materials to realistically forecast the behavior of the output signals.
   We also discuss some practical implications of these findings for the
   design and operation of a cement plant.}},

Abstract = {{Although modeling of cross-covariances by fitting the linear model of
   coregionalization (LMC) is considered a cumbersome task,
   cross-covariances are the key for integration of data for multiple
   attributes in environmental hydrology, aquifer and reservoir
   characterizations using multivariate geostatistics. This paper proposes
   a novel method of modeling cross-covariances in the linear model of
   coregionalization (LMC). The classic minimum/maximum autocorrelation
   factors (MAF) method is analyzed and found to be a good tool to
   discriminate the elementary nested structures of directional sample
   covariance matrices. Thus, separate modeling of the scalar sample
   covariance for each MAF factor may allow to obtain the complete LMC
   model for the original attributes after a back rotation of the diagonal
   modelcovariance matrix of directional factors. However, such a back
   rotation is not computable following the classic MAF formulation. This
   paper introduces an ambi-rotational minimum/maximum autocorrelation
   factors (AMAF) method that allows a back and forth double rotation of
   the directional diagonal modelcovariance matrix for factors. This
   approach provides a device for modeling of the full matrix of
   directional covariance and cross-covariance for the original attributes
   in the LMC without recurring to iterations. In this way, the use of
   multivariate geostatistics for data integration is allowed avoiding
   collocated approaches or rotation and modeling of data factor scores.
   The method is illustrated with an example for covariances for three
   attributes.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial structure in plant communities occurs in the forms of (1)
   single-species aggregation and dispersion patterns, (2)
   distance-dependent interactions between species, and (3) the response to
   the spatial structure of environmental conditions. Different methods
   deal with these components of spatial variation: geostatistical analysis
   reveals autocorrelation in a spatial sample; the variance of species
   richness has been used as an indicator for interspecific interactions
   due to niche limitation; and ordination techniques describe multispecies
   responses to environmental factors. Based on the mathematical properties
   of presence-absence data, it is shown how variogram modeling, the
   testing of interspecific associations, and multiscale ordination can be
   integrated using the same set of distance-dependent variance-covariance
   matrices (variogram matrix). The variogram matrix partitions the
   variance of community data into spatial components at the levels of the
   individual species, species composition, and species richness. It can be
   used to factor out the effects of single-species aggregation patterns,
   interspecific interactions, or environmental heterogeneity. The
   mathematical integration of traditionally unrelated methods increases
   the interpretability of variograms of plant communities, provides a
   spatial extension and an empirical null model for the variance test of
   species richness, and extends multiscale ordination to nonsystematic
   spatial samples. Beyond the individual applications, the variogram
   matrix provides a framework for a mathematical unification of
   geostatistics, multivariate data analysis, and the analysis of variance
   that may enable ecologists from a broad range of fields to incorporate
   spatial effects into their research and to integrate analyses across
   different levels of biological organization.}},

Number = {{1}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{If we wish to describe the coregionalization of two or more soil
   properties for estimation by cokriging then we must estimate and model
   their auto- and cross-variogram(s). The conventional estimates of these
   variograms, obtained by the method-of-moments, are unduly affected by
   outlying data which inflate the variograms and so also the estimates of
   the error variance of cokriging predictions. Robust estimators are less
   affected. Robust estimators of the auto-variogram and the pseudo
   cross-variogram have previously been proposed and used successfully, but
   the multivariate problem of estimating the cross-variogram robustly has
   not yet been tackled.
   Two robust estimators of the cross-variogram are proposed. These use
   covariance estimators with good robustness properties. The robust
   estimators of the cross-variogram proved more resistant to outliers than
   did the method-of-moments estimator when applied to simulated fields
   which were then contaminated.
   Organic carbon and water content of the soil was measured at 256 sites
   on a transect and the method-of-moments estimator, and the two robust
   estimators, were used to estimate the auto-variograms and
   cross-variogram from a prediction subset of 156 sites. The data on
   organic carbon included a few outliers. The method-of-moments estimator
   returned larger values of the auto- and cross-variograms than did either
   robust estimator. The organic carbon content at the 100 validation sites
   on the transect was estimated by cokriging from the prediction data plus
   a set of variograms fitted to the method-of-moments estimates and two
   sets of variograms fitted to the robust estimates. The ratio of the
   actual squared prediction error to the cokriging estimate of the error
   variance was computed at each validation site. These results showed that
   cokriging using variograms obtained by the method-of-moments estimator
   overestimated the error variance of the predictions. By contrast,
   cokriging with the robustly estimated variograms gave reliable estimates
   of the error variance of the predictions.}},

Abstract = {{During the past decade. the Bayesian maxi I mum entropy (BME) approach
   has been used with considerable success in a variety of geostatistical
   applications, including the spatiotemporal analysis and estimation of
   multivariate distributions. In this work, we investigate methods for
   calculating the space/time moments of such distributions that occur in
   BME mapping applications, and we propose general expressions for
   non-Gaussian model densities based on Gaussian averages. Two explicit
   approximations for the covariance are derived, one based on
   leading-order perturbation analysis and the other on the diagrammatic
   method. The leading-order estimator is accurate only for weekly
   non-Gaussian densities. The diagrammatic estimator includes higher-order
   terms and is accurate for larger non-Gaussian deviations. Ve also
   formulate general expressions for Monte Carlo moment calculations
   including precision estimates, A numerical algorithm based on importance
   sampling is developed, which is computationally efficient for
   multivariate probability, densities with a large number of points in
   space/time. We also investigate the BME moment problem, which consists
   in determining the general knowledge-based BME density from experimental
   measurements. In the case of multivariate densities, this problem
   requires solving a system of nonlinear integral equations. We
   reformulate the system of equations as an optimization problem, which we
   then solve numerically for a symmetric univariate pdf. Finally, we
   discuss theoretical and numerical issues related to multivariate BME
   solutions.}},

Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{397-419}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Assessment of the sampling variance of the experimental variogram is an
   important topic in geostatistics as it gives the uncertainty of the
   variogram estimates. This assessment however is repeatedly overlooked in
   most applications mainly, perhaps, because a general approach has not
   been implemented in the most commonly used software packages for
   variogram analysis. In this paper the authors propose a solution that
   can be implemented easily in a computer program, and which, subject to
   certain assumptions, is exact. These assumptions are not very
   restrictive: second-order stationarity (the process has a finite
   variance and the variogram has a sill) and, solely for the purpose of
   evaluating fourth-order moments, a Gaussian distribution for the random
   function. The approach described here gives the variance-covariance
   matrix of the experimental variogram, which takes into account not only
   the correlation among the experiemental values but also the multiple use
   of data in the variogram computation. Among other applications, standard
   errors may be attached to the variogram estimates and the
   variance-covariance matrix may be used for fitting a theoretical model
   by weighted, or by generalized, least squares. Confidence regions that
   hold a given confidence level for all the variogram lag estimates
   simultaneously have been calculated using the Bonferroni method for
   rectangular intervals, and using the multivariate Gaussian assumption
   for K-dimensional elliptical intervals (where K is the number of
   experimental variogram estimates). A general approach for incorporating
   the uncertainty of the experimental variogram into the uncertainty of
   the variogram model parameters is also shown. A case study with rainfall
   data is used to illustrate the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{The geostatistical spatial modelling framework envisions a random
   spatial process model Y(s) over a region S which is observed at spatial
   Locations, say, s(1), s(2),..., s(n). In the stationary Gaussian case, a
   mean function and a covariance function fully specify the process. Here,
   we consider data which, instead, is related to pairs of locations. Such
   data, denoted by Y(s(i), s(j)) for the pair s(i), s(j) is customarily
   referred to as spatial interaction data. We adopt a much broader view of
   such data but still seek a geostatistical modelling framework. We also
   wish to accommodate samples of independent but not identically
   distributed responses at each pair. These responses need not follow a
   Gaussian model. Our approach is to introduce a hierarchical model
   capturing spatial interaction at the second stage using a bivariate
   Gaussian spatial process. Very flexible classes of models result. We
   illustrate with an application to postal service performance with regard

Abstract = {{Soil information related to a region may only be available in aggregated
   form (e.g., a physical average value from bulked sampling or a mean
   value for a land facet or similar map unit). When this information is to
   be used as input to a model that describes processes in smaller units
   (e.g., the pedon) then it must be disaggregated to an appropriate scale.
   It is shown how the sectioning method of Addiscott and Wagenet
   {[}Addiscott, T.M., Wagenet, R.J., 1985. A simple method for combining
   soil properties that show variability. Soil Sci. Sec. Am. J. 49,
   1365-1369] may be used for this purpose. The sectioning method is
   extended by using a (univariate or multivariate) linear model of
   (co)regionalisation of the variables to compute the variances and
   covariances of disaggregated soil properties. It is shown how the
   eigenvectors of the disaggregated covariance matrix can be used to
   compute equiprobable sections for correlated soil properties. The
   methods are demonstrated using the SLIM model, a functional model of
   leaching. The results obtained are comparable to those from Monte Carlo
   analysis, and emphasise the importance of accounting for the spatial
   variability that underlies aggregated soil information. It is proposed
   that cost-effective spatial sampling to determine variograms of soil
   properties and/or the use of average variograms from comparable regions
   could provide the information to make this a practicable method for

Volume = {{31}},

Pages = {{85-103}},

Abstract = {{This paper extends the concept of dispersion variance to the
   multivariate case where the change of support affects dispersion
   covariances and the matrix of correlation between attributes. This leads
   to a concept of correlation between attributes as a function of sample
   supports and size of the physical domain. Decomposition of dispersion
   covariances into the spatial scales of variability provides a tool for
   computing the contribution to variability from different spatial
   components. Coregionalized dispersion covariances and elementary
   dispersion variances are defined for each multivariate spatial scale of
   variability This allows the computation of dispersion covariances and
   correlation between attributes without integrating the cross-variograms.
   A correlation matrix, for a second-order stationary field with point
   support and infinite domain, converges toward constant correlation
   coefficients. The regionalized correlation coefficients for each spatial
   scale of variability, and the cases where the intrinsic correlation
   hypothesis holds are Sound independent of support and size of domain.
   This approach opens possibilities for multivariate geostatistics with
   data taken at different support. Two numerical examples from soil
   textural data demonstrate the change of correlation matrix with the size
   of the domain. In general, correlation between attributes is extended
   from the classic Pearson correlation coefficient based on independent
   samples to a most general approach for dependent samples taken with
   different support in a limited domain.}},

Abstract = {{It is often convenient to use synthetically generated random fields to
   study the hydrologic effects of spatial heterogeneity. Although there
   are many ways to produce such fields, spectral techniques are
   particularly attractive because they are fast and conceptually
   straightforward. This paper describes a spectral algorithm for
   generating sets of random fields which are correlated with one another.
   The algorithm is based on a discrete version of the Fourier-Stieltjes
   representation for multidimensional random fields. The Fourier increment
   used in this representation depends on a random phase angle process and
   a complex-valued spectral factor matrix which can be readily derived
   from a specified set of cross-spectral densities (or cross-covariances).
   The inverse Fourier transform of the Fourier increment is a complex
   random field with real and imaginary parts which each have the desired
   coveriance structure. Our complex-valued spectral formulation provides
   an especially convenient way to generate a set of random fields which
   all depend on a single underlying (independent) field, provided that the
   fields in question can be related by space-invariant linear
   transformations. We illustrate this by generating multi-dimensional mass
   conservative groundwater velocity fields which can be used to simulate
   solute transport through heterogeneous anisotropic porous media. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, the maximum likelihood method for inferring the
   parameters of spatial covariances is examined. The advantages of the
   maximum likelihood estimation are discussed and it is shown that this
   method, derived assuming a multivariate Gaussian distribution for the
   data, gives a sound criterion of fitting covariance models irrespective
   of the multivariate distribution of the data. However, this distribution
   is impossible to verify in practice when only one realization of the
   random function is available. Then, the maximum entropy method is the
   only sound criterion of assigning probabilities in absence of
   information. Because the multivariate Gaussian distribution has the
   maximum entropy property for a fixed vector of means and covariance
   matrix, the multinormal distribution is the most logical choice as a
   default distribution for the experimental data. Nevertheless, it should
   be clear that the assumption of a multivariate Gaussian distribution is
   maintained only for the inference of spatial covariance parameters and
   nor necessarily for other operations such as spatial interpolation,
   simulation or estimation of spatial distributions. Various results from
   simulations are presented to support the claim that the simultaneous use

Abstract = {{The numerical stability of linear systems arising in kriging,
   estimation, and simulation of random fields, is studied analytically and
   numerically. In the state-space formulation of kriging, as developed
   here, the stability of the kriging system depends on the condition
   number of the prior, stationary covariance matrix. The same is true for
   conditional random field generation by the superposition method, which
   is based on kriging, and the multivariate Gaussian method, which
   requires factoring a covariance matrix. A large condition number
   corresponds to an ill-conditioned, numerically unstable system. In the
   case of stationary covariance matrices and uniform grids, as occurs in
   kriging of uniformly sampled data, the degree of ill-conditioning
   generally increases indefinitely with sampling density and, to a limit,
   with domain size. The precise behavior is, however, highly sensitive to
   the underlying covariance model Detailed analytical and numerical
   results are given for five one-dimensional covariance models: (1)
   hole-exponential, (2) exponential, (3) linear-exponential, (4)
   hole-Gaussian, and (5) Gaussian. This list reflects an approximate
   ranking of the models, from `'best'' to `'worst'' conditioned. The
   methods developed in this work can be used to analyze other covariance
   models. Examples of such representative analyses, conducted in this
   work, include the spherical and periodic hole-effect (hole-sinusoidal)
   covariance models. The effect of small-scale variability (nugget) is
   addressed and extensions to irregular sampling schemes and higher
   dimensional spaces are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Most studies of relations between soil properties fail to take account
   of their regionalized nature because of the lack of appropriate methods.
   This paper describes a geostatistical technique, factorial kriging
   analysis, that bridges the gap between classical multivariate analysis
   and a univariate geostatistical approach. The basic feature of the
   method is the fitting of a linear model of coregionalization, i.e. all
   experimental simple and cross-variograms are modelled with a linear
   combination of basic variogram functions. A particular variance
   covariance matrix, the coregionalization matrix, can then be associated
   with each spatial scale defined by the range of the basic variogram
   function. Each coregionalization matrix describes relationships between
   variables at given spatial scale. A principal component analysis of
   these matrices produces a set of components, the regionalized factors,
   that reflect the main features of the multivariate information for each
   spatial scale and whose scores are estimated by cokriging.
   The technique is described and illustrated with three case studies based
   on a simulated data set and soil survey data. The results are compared
   with those of the principal component analysis of the
   variance-covariance matrix and the variogram matrices.}},

Abstract = {{A multivariate geostatistical technique is presented to address two key
   issues of trend detection and network evaluation of acid deposition
   data. The proposed technique is specifically designed to be compatible
   with the distinctive characteristics of acid deposition variables such
   as non-stationarity of their spatial means, non-stationarity of their
   spatial covariances, their complex periodic and non-periodic temporal
   trends, and the common imbalance between the availability of their
   spatial and temporal data. To accomplish this, the time series at each
   measurement point is viewed as a separate, but correlated
   one-dimensional regionalized variable. Each variable is assumed to be a
   sum of periodic (e.g. seasonal) and non-periodic (e.g. anthropogenic)
   temporal random variables, each characterized by its own temporal
   variogram. To obtain an initial estimate of the frequency of the
   involved periodic trends, direct quadratic spectrum estimation is
   conducted. Based on fitted direct and cross variograms, various forms of
   estimation such as co-kriging of non-periodic components can be
   performed. The estimated time series may then be tested for the presence
   of long-term trends. In addition, the fitted sill values of any
   variogram model at different stations form elements of a
   coregionalization matrix. This matrix may be regarded as the
   variance-covariance matrix for the particular temporal-trend scale
   presented by the variogram model. A coregionalization matrix can be used
   to generate a spatial correlogram. Viewing the estimated integral scale
   of each spatial correlogram as an indicator of the radius of
   information-influence of each measurement station, a monitoring network
   can be evaluated for its adequacy of coverage at different
   temporal-trend scales. A coregionalization matrix can also be decomposed
   through principal-component analysis in order to determine any potential
   spatial groupings and/or to generate regional indicators of changes at
   different temporal scales.}},

Abstract = {{An analog method is used to simulate a discrete transmissivity field
   free of the artifacts inherent in conventional multivariate Gaussian
   statistical generation methods.  The simulated field provides a
   realistic model of a formation exhibiting the spatial continuity of
   extreme transmissivities which gives rise to barriers and preferential
   channels for flow.  The heterogeneous transmissivity field and the
   corresponding steady-state head and discharge fields are characterized
   in a geostatistical framework and observed spatial statistics are
   compared with theoretical results from the stochastic hydrogeology
   literature.  The simulated transmissivity field exhibits a bimodal
   distribution and strong directional anisotropy with nested scales of
   heterogeneity.  Despite these significant departures from standard
   models, the observed head covariance and head-log transmissivity
   cross-covariance agree well with theory.  The spatial covariance of
   specific discharge is highly anisotropic reflecting preferential
   channeling in the mean direction of flow and the conservation of flux
   along streamlines.  The effective transmissivity of the field is
   predicted more accurately by the spatial geometric average than by
   theoretical models despite the flow channeling and the anisotropy of
   heterogeneity.  Tracer spreading, modeled by particle tracking, is
   non-Fickian at displacements of up to 13.4 times the log-transmissivity
   integral range because transport behavior is dominated by convection
   along a small number of preferential channels.  The observed scale
   dependence of apparent longitudinal dispersivity is predicted generally
   well by theory.  Results of this study suggest that ensemble theoretical
   models based on perturbation approaches can provide reasonable estimates
   of general flow and transport properties of single field realizations
   under moderate conditions of heterogeneity.}},
